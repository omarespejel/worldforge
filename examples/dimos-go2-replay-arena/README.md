# DimOS Go2 Replay Arena

Checkout-safe replay arena for testing whether WorldForge adds decision evidence above a DimOS
Go2 replay or simulation surface.

This example does not import DimOS, connect to hardware, start a browser simulator, or claim a
learned latent model. It consumes a small JSON fixture shaped like a DimOS replay frame, generates
candidate Go2 actions, scores them with transparent costs, and writes a decision trace plus a
compact report.

## Run

```bash
uv run python examples/dimos-go2-replay-arena/run.py \
  --fixture examples/dimos-go2-replay-arena/fixtures/go2_office_replay_frame.json \
  --out .worldforge/dimos-go2-replay-arena
```

Run every bundled replay fixture and write a batch comparison table:

```bash
uv run python examples/dimos-go2-replay-arena/run.py \
  --all-fixtures \
  --out .worldforge/dimos-go2-replay-arena-batch
```

Run the bundled PimSim-shaped JSON export through the same arena:

```bash
uv run python examples/dimos-go2-replay-arena/run.py \
  --pimsim-export \
  --out .worldforge/dimos-go2-pimsim-export
```

Expected success signal:

- `.worldforge/dimos-go2-replay-arena/decision-trace.json` exists.
- `.worldforge/dimos-go2-replay-arena/report.md` exists.
- The trace includes `selected_action`, `score_margin`, `baseline_regret`, and scored
  counterfactual candidates.
- Batch mode writes `batch-report.json`, `batch-report.md`, and one per-fixture trace/report
  directory.
- PimSim export mode writes `converted-replay-fixture.json`, `decision-trace.json`, and
  `report.md` without importing DimOS or starting PimSim.

First triage step: open `decision-trace.json` and verify that the candidate count matches the
fixture and that every scored candidate has `distance_cost`, `obstacle_risk`, `uncertainty_cost`,
and `relocalization_cost` components.

The bundled fixtures exercise both sides of the decision-evidence claim:

- `go2_office_replay_frame.json` should reject the hardcoded `baseline_forward` action and choose
  `stop_relocalize` because localization is weak and forward motion clips risky map geometry.
- `go2_clear_hallway_replay_frame.json` should preserve `baseline_forward` because the hallway is
  clear and the baseline reaches the goal with the lowest transparent cost.
- `pimsim_exports/go2_pimsim_hallway_snapshot.json` is shaped from DimOS `pim/dev` PimSim concepts
  (`EntityStateBatch`, robot entity id, goal, and candidate actions) and should convert to a replay
  fixture before scoring.

## Kill Criterion

WorldForge earns its place only if it improves robot decision-making evidence. If this arena only
logs a DimOS command without choosing, explaining, comparing, or exposing counterfactual actions,
the integration should be stopped or redesigned.
