<identity>
WorldForge is a Python integration layer and CLI for physical-AI world-model provider adapters, world state, planning, evaluation, benchmarking, diagnostics, and host-owned optional runtimes.
</identity>

<priority_rules>
1. Keep provider capabilities truthful: advertise only callable, tested, typed WorldForge surfaces.
2. Make the library fault tolerant, resilient, and forgiving, you should make the dev experience a top priority and help fixing issues and overcoming challenges. feel free to addadd torch, LeWorldModel, LeRobot, GR00T, CUDA, checkpoints, datasets, or robot controllers to base dependencies or the repo when relevant.
3. Fail loudly at boundaries: invalid public inputs raise `WorldForgeError`; malformed persisted/provider state raises `WorldStateError`; provider/runtime failures raise `ProviderError`.
4. Preserve local-first scope: no hosted service, production database, credential store, robot safety layer, telemetry backend, or durable multi-writer persistence unless explicitly designed and approved.
5. Public contribution artifacts must be human, maintainer-style, and tool-neutral. Do not mention agent/tool branding in branch names, commits, PR titles, PR bodies, changelog, docs, or README copy.

<structure>
Top-level boundaries:

| Path | Purpose | Agent zone |
| --- | --- | --- |

<provider_contracts>
Capability names are strict: `predict`, `generate`, `reason`, `embed`, `plan`, `transfer`, `score`, `policy`.

| Provider | Truthful surface | Registration trigger | Do not claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mock` | `predict`, `generate`, `transfer`, `reason`, `embed`, `plan` | always registered | real physical/media fidelity |
| `cosmos` | `generate` | `COSMOS_BASE_URL` | planning, scoring, local runtime |
| `runway` | `generate`, `transfer` | `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` or `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` | durable artifact storage |
| `leworldmodel` | `score` | `LEWORLDMODEL_POLICY` or `LEWM_POLICY` | predict/generate/reason |
| `gr00t` | `policy` | `GROOT_POLICY_HOST` | world model, score, generate |
| `lerobot` | `policy` | `LEROBOT_POLICY_PATH` or `LEROBOT_POLICY` | world model, score, generate |
| `jepa`, `genie` | scaffold | env-gated mock-backed reservations | real upstream integration |
| `jepa-wms` | direct-construction candidate | none; not exported or auto-registered | catalog availability |
</provider_contracts>

<configuration>
Read tracked config only. Never read `.env`, `.env.*`, keys, or secret files.

Configuration cascade:
1. `pyproject.toml` defines package metadata, scripts, deps, extras, pytest, ruff.
2. `uv.lock` pins resolved dependencies.
3. `.env.example` documents provider environment variables; actual values are host-owned.
4. Provider catalog auto-registers only always-on providers or providers whose required env vars are present.
5. Runtime flags such as CLI `--state-dir`, provider-specific options, and host-injected providers override defaults in process.
</configuration>

<code_conventions>
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` in Python modules.
- Prefer `@dataclass(slots=True)` or `@dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)` for public models where the surrounding code does.
- Validate constructor and boundary values before persistence, outbound HTTP, optional runtime calls, or provider result return.
- Keep JSON-facing payloads typed as `JSONDict` and copy mutable inputs before storing them.
- Use `ProviderCapabilities()` fail-closed by default; opt into each capability explicitly.
- Unsupported provider methods should inherit or raise `ProviderError` with provider context.
- Remote adapters should use typed `ProviderRequestPolicy`/`RequestOperationPolicy`; create/mutation requests stay single-attempt unless idempotency is proven.
- Provider events should use `ProviderEvent` phases `retry`, `success`, and `failure`; targets,
  messages, and metadata must stay sanitized so logs never retain credentials or signed URL query
  strings.
- Keep docs concrete: command, success signal, first triage step.
- Do not add broad abstractions until they remove real duplication across current modules.
</code_conventions>

<workflows>
<bug_fix>
1. Reproduce with the narrowest failing command or test.
2. Patch the root cause in the smallest module boundary.
3. Add or update regression tests, including error paths for documented failure modes.
4. Run focused tests first, then relevant gates from `<commands>`.
5. Update docs/changelog/agent context when public behavior changes.
</bug_fix>

<provider_change>
1. Load `.codex/skills/provider-adapter-development/SKILL.md`.
2. Classify the provider by actual callable behavior, not marketing label.
3. Add fixtures under `tests/fixtures/providers/` for success and malformed/error outputs.
4. Assert `worldforge.testing.assert_provider_contract()` for supported surfaces.
5. Update provider docs and run `uv run python scripts/generate_provider_docs.py`.
6. Run provider-focused tests, docs check, coverage gate, and package contract if public API changes.
</provider_change>

<docs_change>
1. Prefer editing source docs; generated provider catalog blocks must come from `scripts/generate_provider_docs.py`.
2. Keep README front-door concise; route operational detail to `docs/src/playbooks.md` or provider pages.
3. Public behavior changes require matching README/docs/API/changelog/AGENTS updates where relevant.
</docs_change>

<release_or_public_branch>
1. Verify no secrets, `.env`, checkpoints, datasets, `.worldforge/`, caches, `dist/`, or `build/` are staged.
2. Run full local gate from `<commands>`.
3. Use maintainer-style, tool-neutral branch/commit/PR text.
4. Do not push directly to `main` unless repo policy and the user explicitly allow it.
</release_or_public_branch>
</workflows>

<boundaries>
<forbidden>
- Do not read or modify `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, credentials, tokens, checkpoints, downloaded datasets, or robot-controller secrets.
- Do not add heavy optional runtimes or model assets to base dependencies or repository files.
- Do not silently coerce invalid world state or provider output.
- Do not weaken coverage gates, lint rules, security checks, package validation, or provider docs generation.
- Do not present deterministic evaluation suites or mock providers as physical-fidelity evidence.
- Do not export or auto-register `JEPAWMSProvider` without explicit validated-runtime design approval.
</forbidden>

<gated>
Require explicit approval before modifying:
- `.github/workflows/*`
- dependency or package metadata in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
- public API exports in `src/worldforge/__init__.py`
- public model/error/capability contracts in `src/worldforge/models.py`
- persistence contract in `src/worldforge/framework.py`
- provider base/catalog registration semantics in `src/worldforge/providers/base.py` and `src/worldforge/providers/catalog.py`
- release/publish behavior in `scripts/test_package.sh`, release workflow, or `Makefile`
- deleting tracked files or changing branch/merge/release policy
</gated>

<autonomous>
Safe to do without additional approval when aligned with the task:
- read repo files except forbidden secrets.
- add or update tests for changed behavior.
- fix lint, formatting, type, docs-drift, and focused CI failures.
- update docs/changelog/agent context for changed public behavior.
- add deterministic fixtures and examples that do not require live services.
</autonomous>
</boundaries>

<troubleshooting>
| Symptom | Likely cause | First fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uv lock --check` fails | dependency metadata changed without lock update | confirm dependency change is approved, then refresh lock |
| provider docs drift | catalog/rendered README blocks stale | `uv run python scripts/generate_provider_docs.py`, inspect diff |
| optional provider unexpectedly registered | shell env has provider variables set | inspect sanitized environment names only; never read `.env` |
| capability filter rejects a name | unknown capability string | use one of `CAPABILITY_NAMES` |
| coverage gate fails | changed behavior lacks tests | add focused success and failure-path tests |
| package contract fails after passing local tests | wheel/sdist missing file or import path | inspect `pyproject.toml` hatch include/package settings and `scripts/test_package.sh` output |
| Textual import fails in base CLI/import | optional harness dependency leaked | move Textual import back under `src/worldforge/harness/tui.py` or harness extra path |
| remote media artifact fails | parser/retry/download/expired URL issue | inspect provider events and provider-specific docs; do not log secrets |

<skills>
Project skills live in `.codex/skills/`; `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` must be symlinks to that directory.

Load skills on demand:
- `.codex/skills/provider-adapter-development/SKILL.md`: adding, promoting, or debugging providers (bundled `references/capability-matrix.md`).
- `.codex/skills/testing-validation/SKILL.md`: test selection, coverage, package, docs, CI gates (bundled `references/release-gate.md`).
- `.codex/skills/evaluation-benchmarking/SKILL.md`: evaluation suites, benchmarks, report claims.
- `.codex/skills/optional-runtime-smokes/SKILL.md`: LeWorldModel, GR00T, LeRobot live or injected runtime checks.
- `.codex/skills/persistence-state/SKILL.md`: world IDs, local JSON state, history import/export.
- `.codex/skills/tui-development/SKILL.md`: TheWorldHarness Textual TUI — screens, workers, command palette, snapshot tests (bundled `references/roadmap.md`).
