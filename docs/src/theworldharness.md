# TheWorldHarness

TheWorldHarness is an optional Textual TUI for running WorldForge integration flows as visible,
inspectable traces. It is the default integration reference for how provider surfaces, planning,
execution, persistence, diagnostics, benchmarks, and event inspection fit together.

It is a local tool. It does not require optional ML runtimes unless a selected flow explicitly
does, and the current flows use deterministic checkout-safe paths.

The real robotics showcase also uses the Textual surface, but it is launched through
`scripts/robotics-showcase` rather than the checkout-safe harness flow. That command runs the real
LeRobot policy plus real LeWorldModel checkpoint path first, then opens a standalone report with the
pipeline, runtime metrics, staged reveal, illustrative robot-arm animation, candidate cost
landscape, provider events, and tabletop replay. Pass `--tui-stage-delay <seconds>` to tune the
reveal pace or `--no-tui` to keep the plain terminal report.

## Install Boundary

Textual is optional. The base package keeps `httpx` as its only runtime dependency.

```bash
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow lerobot
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow cosmos-policy
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow gr00t-replay
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow robotics-compare
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow diagnostics
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow workbench
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow eval
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow benchmark
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow runs
uv run worldforge harness --list
uv run worldforge harness --list --format json
uv run worldforge harness --connectors
uv run worldforge harness --connectors --format json
uv run worldforge harness --runs --provider mock --status failed --artifact-type json
```

Installed package:

```bash
pip install "worldforge-ai[harness]"
worldforge-harness
```

Without the `harness` extra, metadata commands still work:

```bash
uv run worldforge harness --list
uv run worldforge harness --list --format json
uv run worldforge harness --connectors --format json
uv run worldforge provider workbench mock
uv run worldforge provider workbench runway --format json
```

Launching the TUI without Textual exits with an install hint instead of importing optional
dependencies at package import time.

## Current Flows

| Flow | Provider surface | What it visualizes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leworldmodel` | `score` | Deterministic LeWorldModel-shaped cost runtime, candidate scoring, score planning, execution, persistence, reload, provider events. |
| `lerobot` | `policy` plus score provider | Deterministic LeRobot-shaped policy, action translation, policy candidate ranking, execution, persistence, reload, provider events. |
| `cosmos-policy` | `policy` | Saved Cosmos-Policy ALOHA `/act` replay through the real provider adapter, json_numpy 50 x 14 action validation, action translation, provider events, and a sanitized replay artifact. |
| `gr00t-replay` | `policy` | Saved GR00T N1.7 PolicyClient replay through the real provider adapter, named eef/gripper/joint tensor validation, action translation, provider events, and a sanitized replay artifact. |
| `robotics-compare` | policy comparison | LeRobot, Cosmos-Policy, and GR00T replay paths compared side by side by action shape, translated action count, provider events, and sanitized artifacts without requiring live GPU servers. |
| `diagnostics` | provider catalog plus benchmark harness | `doctor()` provider scan, registered/unregistered provider status, mock benchmark matrix across predict/reason/generate/transfer/embed, latency/throughput comparison, provider events. |
| `workbench` | provider authoring | Checkout-safe provider workbench evidence for stable and candidate adapters, promotion gaps, safe artifacts, and validation commands. |

For the Cosmos replay, run
`uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow cosmos-policy`. A good run reports
`raw_action_shape: [50, 14]`, `translated_actions: 50`, and
`saved_replay_artifact: artifacts/cosmos-policy-replay.json`. If it fails, start with the preserved
run workspace: inspect `logs/provider-events.jsonl` for the provider phase and
`artifacts/cosmos-policy-replay.json` for the saved request/response/translated-action artifact.

For the GR00T replay, run
`uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow gr00t-replay`. A good run reports
`translated_actions: 40`, raw tensor shapes for `eef_9d`, `gripper_position`, and
`joint_position`, and `saved_replay_artifact: artifacts/gr00t-replay.json`. The committed artifact
is deterministic and checkout-safe; the live RTX A6000 validation is mentioned as provenance, not
stored as GPU logs, checkpoints, private endpoints, or raw observations. If it fails, start with
the preserved run workspace: inspect `logs/provider-events.jsonl` for provider events/errors and
`artifacts/gr00t-replay.json` for the saved replay request/response/translated-action artifact.

For the robotics comparison, run
`uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow robotics-compare`. A good run reports
`total_translated_actions: 92` and
`comparison_artifact: artifacts/robotics-policy-comparison.json`. If it fails, inspect
`logs/provider-events.jsonl` and the comparison artifact first; the replay artifacts remain
checkout-safe and do not include raw observations or checkpoint files.

## Provider Connector Workspace

The Providers screen and `worldforge harness --connectors --format json` use the same
Textual-free readiness model. Each known provider is grouped as `configured`,
`missing_credentials`, `missing_dependency`, `unhealthy`, or `scaffold`, with value-free required
environment names, optional runtime dependency names, a first smoke command, and triage steps.

This surface intentionally reports presence and status only. It does not print environment values,
tokens, endpoints, checkpoint paths, or constructor-provided secrets.

## What The Interface Shows

The harness now exposes the main WorldForge surfaces directly:

- Home: jump cards plus recent worlds and preserved reports.
- Worlds: create, edit, save, fork, delete, and preview local JSON worlds through `WorldForge`.
- Providers: registered-provider capability matrix, health details, and cancellable `mock.predict`.
- Eval: built-in deterministic suites with capability errors surfaced as hard toasts.
- Benchmark: provider-operation latency, retry, and throughput runs with live samples.
- Run Inspector: timeline, metrics, sanitized provider-event table, validation errors, transcript,
  and export preview for flows and reports.

Flow and report views are rendered from the same structured `HarnessRun` object used in tests.
The provider, eval, and benchmark screens call the same Python APIs as the CLI; report artifacts
use the canonical JSON / Markdown / CSV renderers.

Every harness flow preserves the final inspector state under
`.worldforge/runs/<run-id>/results/inspector.json`, writes sanitized provider events to
`logs/provider-events.jsonl`, and links both artifacts from `run_manifest.json`. If a flow fails
before provider work completes, the manifest status is `failed` rather than left as `running`; the
inspector still records the command, redacted validation error, and failure event needed to
reproduce the run.

The diagnostics, eval, and benchmark screens map directly to non-TUI commands:

```bash
uv run worldforge doctor --registered-only
uv run worldforge provider list
uv run worldforge provider workbench mock
uv run worldforge harness --flow workbench
uv run worldforge benchmark --provider mock --iterations 2 --format json
uv run worldforge eval --suite planning --provider mock --format json
```

## Provider Workbench

`worldforge provider workbench <provider>` is the checkout-safe adapter author loop behind the
harness provider development workflow. It does not import Textual and does not make live provider
calls unless `--live` is passed explicitly. The same non-Textual report model powers the
`worldforge harness --flow workbench` TUI path. The default report is designed to paste into GitHub
issues or PR descriptions: provider profile, target source, required capability conformance helpers,
planned capability surface, runtime manifest status, fixture JSON status, docs/catalog drift hints,
redaction-safe provider event status, promotion evidence grouped by future status, safe artifact
references, and exact validation commands.

```bash
uv run worldforge provider workbench mock
uv run worldforge provider workbench jepa-wms --format markdown
uv run worldforge provider workbench genie --format json
uv run worldforge provider workbench runway --format json
uv run worldforge provider workbench runway --live
uv run worldforge harness --flow workbench
```

For deterministic local providers such as `mock`, the workbench invokes the advertised capability
helpers. For scaffold or direct-construction candidates such as `genie` and `jepa-wms`, it names
missing evidence by promotion status instead of implying the provider is ready. For HTTP adapters it
validates matching `tests/fixtures/providers/<provider>_*.json` or Python module-safe fixture
prefixes such as `jepa_wms_*.json`, and lists the capability helpers that the provider test module
must cover. For host-owned local runtimes such as LeRobot and LeWorldModel, the default path
inspects profile, health, docs, runtime manifests, and fixtures while leaving injected-runtime/live
smoke execution to prepared hosts. Run
`uv run python scripts/generate_provider_docs.py --check` before opening a provider PR so profile
metadata and generated catalog tables stay in sync.

Completed checkout-safe flows also preserve a sanitized run workspace:

```text
.worldforge/runs/<run-id>/
|-- run_manifest.json
|-- inputs/
|-- results/
|-- reports/
|-- artifacts/
`-- logs/
```

Run IDs are UTC-sortable and file-safe (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-xxxxxxxx`). The manifest records the
command, provider surface, status, input summary, result summary, event count, and relative artifact
paths. It intentionally stores summaries and report renderings, not credentials, raw signed URLs, or
provider-owned private data.

The CLI can write the same layout for evaluation and benchmark runs:

```bash
uv run worldforge eval --suite planning --provider mock --run-workspace .worldforge
uv run worldforge benchmark --provider mock --operation predict --run-workspace .worldforge
uv run worldforge runs list
uv run worldforge runs compare .worldforge/runs/<run-a> .worldforge/runs/<run-b>
uv run worldforge runs cleanup --keep 20
uv run worldforge harness --runs --provider mock --capability predict --status failed
```

Completed eval and benchmark TUI screens still write JSON under `.worldforge/reports/` relative to
the active state directory for the Home screen and `Ctrl+P` recent-report index. Use the run
workspace when a full issue attachment needs manifest, reports, logs, and result summaries together.
The Runs screen and `worldforge harness --runs` read the preserved run manifests directly without
optional model runtimes. They filter by provider, capability, status, created date, and safe
artifact type; each row exposes a sanitized rerun command, issue-bundle export command, and
comparison command where the run type supports comparison. Failed, skipped, and cancelled rows show
the recovery command first:

```bash
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow runs
uv run worldforge harness --runs --status failed --artifact-type json --format json
uv run worldforge runs bundle <run-id> --workspace-dir .worldforge
```

Use `runs compare --format json|markdown|csv|html` to export attachment-safe comparisons across
preserved eval, benchmark, or demo-showcase runs. The CLI and harness comparison path share one
report model: compatible cross-provider runs keep metric deltas, event counts, budget status,
fixture digest, suite version, missing evidence, and skip reasons; mismatched capability,
operation, fixture, budget, or suite context fails before writing a comparison. Add
`--mode regression` when the first path is the preserved baseline and the second path is the
candidate; the report calls out metric deltas, budget violations, new or removed failures, safe
artifact drift, provenance differences, and unsafe artifact exclusions without updating baselines.

## Interface Contract

The TUI is intentionally separated from the rest of the project:

| Module | Dependency boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `worldforge.harness.models` | Dataclasses only; no Textual import. |
| `worldforge.harness.flows` | Runs packaged demos and builds timeline, metrics, and transcript data; no Textual import. |
| `worldforge.harness.cli` | Lists flows without Textual; imports the TUI only when launching it. |
| `worldforge.harness.tui` | The only Textual-dependent module. |

The harness does not replace the Python APIs or command-line demos. It makes the same flows
observable: selected candidates, costs, action paths, saved world ids, final object positions,
provider health, benchmark latency, benchmark throughput, and provider event phases.

## Interaction Model

- `r`: run the selected flow.
- `1`: select LeWorldModel score planning.
- `2`: select LeRobot policy-plus-score planning.
- `3`: select Cosmos-Policy ALOHA replay.
- `4`: select GR00T DROID replay.
- `5`: select robotics policy replay comparison.
- `6`: select provider diagnostics and benchmark comparison.
- `7`: select adapter author workbench.
- `g w`: jump to Worlds.
- `g p`: jump to Providers.
- `g e`: jump to Eval.
- `g b`: jump to Benchmark.
- `g u`: jump to Runs.
- `Ctrl+P`: search static commands plus worlds, providers, recent report files, and preserved run
  workspaces.
- `Ctrl+T`: cycle `worldforge-dark`, `worldforge-light`, and `worldforge-high-contrast`.
- `q`: quit.

Each run reveals stages through a timeline, then fills the inspector and transcript panes from the
same structured `HarnessRun` data used by tests.

## Themes

The harness registers three themes:

- `worldforge-dark`: default dark workspace.
- `worldforge-light`: light-terminal variant.
- `worldforge-high-contrast`: higher-contrast variant for dense screens and reduced-colour
  terminals.

Widget CSS uses semantic tokens only; raw colour values live in `worldforge.harness.theme`.

## Screenshot Refresh

The README image is regenerated from a deterministic harness state. The tracked refresh command is:

```bash
scripts/regen-harness-screenshot.sh
```

It seeds a local screenshot state directory, drives the providers screen through Textual's test
harness, exports SVG, and renders the README PNG with `rsvg-convert`.

## Roadmap

TheWorldHarness is evolving from the read-only demo viewer described above into the project's
front-door interactive workspace — keyboard-first, command-palette-driven, and the canonical
example of how to compose WorldForge from Python. The work is broken into six milestones
(M0–M5), each with a published spec triad (`spec.md` + `plan.md` + `tasks.md`) under
[`specs/`](https://github.com/AbdelStark/worldforge/tree/main/specs):

| Milestone | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| [M0 — Theme + chrome reset](https://github.com/AbdelStark/worldforge/tree/main/specs/theworldharness-M0-theme-chrome) | Registered light/dark themes, semantic CSS variables, header clock and breadcrumb. |
| [M1 — Screen architecture](https://github.com/AbdelStark/worldforge/tree/main/specs/theworldharness-M1-screen-architecture) | App split into named `Screen`s, `push_screen` navigation, `?` help overlay, `Ctrl+P` system commands. |
| [M2 — Worlds CRUD](https://github.com/AbdelStark/worldforge/tree/main/specs/theworldharness-M2-worlds-crud) | Create / edit / save / fork / delete worlds entirely from the TUI through the public `WorldForge` API. |
| [M3 — Live providers](https://github.com/AbdelStark/worldforge/tree/main/specs/theworldharness-M3-live-providers) | `ProvidersScreen` with capability matrix and one real provider call streamed through a worker; `Esc` cancels. |
| [M4 — Eval + Benchmark](https://github.com/AbdelStark/worldforge/tree/main/specs/theworldharness-M4-eval-benchmark) | `EvalScreen` and `BenchmarkScreen`; capability mismatch as a hard toast; reports preserved to disk and exportable. |
| [M5 — Polish + showcase](https://github.com/AbdelStark/worldforge/tree/main/specs/theworldharness-M5-polish-showcase) | High-contrast theme, dynamic command-palette provider, recent items, screenshot export matrix, README screenshot refresh. |

The intent and design language behind these milestones are summarized in the public
[roadmap](./roadmap.md).
