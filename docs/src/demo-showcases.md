# Demo Showcase Workflows

`scripts/demo_showcases.py` is the checkout-safe demo evidence runner for the current showcase
roadmap stream. It composes existing WorldForge examples, diagnostics, preserved-run workspaces,
issue bundles, replay fixtures, and host examples without installing optional model runtimes,
calling paid providers, opening GUIs, or controlling robots.

```bash
uv run python scripts/demo_showcases.py list
uv run python scripts/demo_showcases.py run all --workspace-dir .worldforge/demo-showcases
uv run python scripts/demo_showcases.py run first-run --format json --overwrite
```

Expected success signal: the command exits `0`, reports `status: passed`, and writes one
`run_manifest.json` plus `results/summary.json` and `reports/summary.md` for every selected
workflow. First triage step: open the failed workflow's `workflow-result.json`, then inspect the
referenced preserved run manifest.

## Artifact Layout

The default workspace is `.worldforge/demo-showcases/`.

| Path | Purpose | Safe attachment note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<workflow>/workflow-result.json` | short machine-readable workflow result | safe when `safe_to_attach` is `true` |
| `<workflow>/runs/<run-id>/run_manifest.json` | preserved command, provider, operation, status, artifacts | safe by construction; no raw secrets or signed URLs |
| `<workflow>/runs/<run-id>/results/summary.json` | full workflow summary | safe unless the workflow marks otherwise |
| `<workflow>/runs/<run-id>/reports/summary.md` | human summary with claim boundary and first triage step | safe unless the workflow marks otherwise |
| `<workflow>/issue-bundle/` | issue-ready evidence bundle for the diagnostics workflow | attach only when `evidence_manifest.json` says `safe_to_attach: true` |

## Runtime Boundaries

These workflows prove the WorldForge integration layer and artifact contracts, not upstream model
quality or physical execution. Optional runtimes remain host-owned:

- LeWorldModel, LeRobot, GR00T, torch, checkpoints, simulators, and robot controllers are not
  installed by this runner.
- Provider-event redaction paths use fixture-backed events and do not make paid API calls.
- Rerun is represented by a manifest in the checkout path; `.rrd` generation still requires the
  `rerun` extra or a prepared-host robotics run.
- Provider scaffolds generated by the adapter-author workflow are intentionally incomplete and must
  not be registered or promoted until real fixtures, runtime manifests, docs, and tests pass.
- External provider packages generated by the demo live under the selected workspace and prove
  package shape plus discovery behavior only; they are not published, installed globally, or
  treated as real adapter evidence.
- Custom evaluation suite output is deterministic adapter-contract evidence. Its controlled failed
  case demonstrates report and failure-gallery handling, not provider quality or physical fidelity.
- The policy+score candidate lab uses local deterministic providers to show candidate generation,
  scoring, raw action preservation, translator boundaries, and safe artifact shape. It is not a
  robot controller, simulator, checkpoint run, or physical-performance claim.
- The fixture drift review workflow mutates only the selected demo workspace. It demonstrates
  review states and the approved update path; it does not refresh remote fixtures or rewrite the
  committed snapshot manifest.
- The capability negotiation preflight workflow reports blockers only. It does not install
  optional dependencies, configure credentials, or execute fallback workflows.
- The embodied policy replay comparison preserves LeRobot, GR00T, and Cosmos-Policy action shapes
  separately. It does not perform cross-provider action conversion, contact a live GPU server, or
  claim controller safety.
- The non-developer evidence review package escapes display text and links only relative safe
  artifacts. Host-local paths, signed URLs, and raw provider payloads are marked local-only or
  excluded; the package does not host a dashboard or execute JavaScript.
- The provider failure gallery is fixture-backed. It does not call paid APIs, install optional
  runtimes, preserve signed URLs, or turn scaffold provider rows into integration claims.
- Benchmark failures in the batch workflow are controlled budget failures so the issue and release
  evidence path can be tested without changing production thresholds.
