# Introduction

WorldForge is a Python integration layer for physical-AI world-model systems. It provides provider
capability contracts, world state, planning, evaluation, benchmarking, and diagnostics for local
experiments and adapter development.

The project is built around a strict provider boundary:

- predictive models roll state forward through `predict`
- score models rank candidate action sequences through `score`
- embodied policies propose action chunks through `policy`
- video and media systems expose `generate` or `transfer`
- auxiliary models expose `reason` or `embed` only when those operations are implemented directly

This keeps provider semantics honest. A JEPA cost model is not treated as a video generator. A VLA
robot policy is not treated as a predictive dynamics model. A media generation API is not treated
as proof of controllable physical planning.

WorldForge is for Python developers building provider adapters, local physical-AI experiments,
world-model planning loops, evaluation harnesses, and testable prototypes. It is not a hosted
control plane and it does not own checkpoints, robot runtimes, production telemetry, or durable
multi-writer persistence.

If a page changes public behavior, update the linked operational page and the changelog in the same
branch. WorldForge docs are treated as part of the package contract, not as post-release notes.
