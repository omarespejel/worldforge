# Benchmarking

WorldForge includes a capability-aware benchmark harness for registered full providers and
registered capability protocol implementations. It can measure direct provider surfaces:
`predict`, `reason`, `generate`, `transfer`, `embed`, `score`, and `policy`. `plan` remains a
WorldForge facade workflow, so benchmark score providers and policy providers directly when you
need planning-path latency.

## Python

```python
from worldforge import ProviderBenchmarkHarness

harness = ProviderBenchmarkHarness(forge=forge)
report = harness.run(
    ["mock"],
    operations=["predict", "generate", "transfer", "embed"],
    iterations=5,
    concurrency=2,
)

print(report.to_markdown())
```

If the optional Rerun integration is installed, `RerunArtifactLogger.log_benchmark_report(report)`
records the same report JSON plus per-result metric scalars into a `.rrd` inspection artifact.

Score and policy providers use the same benchmark runner with provider-native inputs supplied by
the host:

```python
from worldforge import BenchmarkInputs, ProviderBenchmarkHarness

inputs = BenchmarkInputs(
    score_info={
        "pixels": [[[[0.0]]]],
        "goal": [[[0.3, 0.5, 0.0]]],
        "action": [[[0.0, 0.5, 0.0]]],
    },
    score_action_candidates=[[[[0.0, 0.5, 0.0]], [[0.3, 0.5, 0.0]]]],
    policy_info={
        "observation": {
            "state": {"cube": [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]},
            "language": "move the cube",
        },
        "mode": "select_action",
    },
)

report = ProviderBenchmarkHarness(forge=forge).run(
    ["leworldmodel", "lerobot"],
    iterations=3,
    inputs=inputs,
)
```

## CLI

```bash
uv run worldforge benchmark --provider mock --iterations 5
uv run worldforge benchmark --provider mock --operation generate --format json
uv run worldforge benchmark --provider mock --operation embed --format markdown
uv run worldforge benchmark --provider mock --operation embed --input-file examples/benchmark-inputs.json
```

Use `--input-file` when a benchmark result needs to be reproducible from preserved inputs. The
file can contain input fields directly, or an `inputs` object plus metadata. The checked-in
`examples/benchmark-inputs.json` fixture is checkout-safe for the mock provider's `predict`,
`generate`, `transfer`, and `embed` operations; score and policy entries require providers that
advertise those capabilities.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "run": "release-smoke"
  },
  "inputs": {
    "prediction_action": {
      "type": "move_to",
      "parameters": {
        "target": { "x": 0.25, "y": 0.5, "z": 0.0 },
        "speed": 1.0
      }
    },
    "prediction_steps": 2,
    "reason_query": "How many objects are tracked?",
    "generation_prompt": "benchmark orbiting cube",
    "generation_duration_seconds": 1.0,
    "transfer_prompt": "benchmark transfer rerender",
    "transfer_width": 320,
    "transfer_height": 180,
    "transfer_fps": 12.0,
    "transfer_clip": {
      "path": "seed-transfer.bin",
      "fps": 8.0,
      "resolution": [160, 90],
      "duration_seconds": 1.0,
      "metadata": { "content_type": "application/octet-stream" }
    },
    "embedding_text": "benchmark cube state",
    "score_info": {
      "pixels": [[[[0.0]]]],
      "goal": [[[0.3, 0.5, 0.0]]],
      "action": [[[0.0, 0.5, 0.0]]]
    },
    "score_action_candidates": [[[[0.0, 0.5, 0.0]], [[0.3, 0.5, 0.0]]]],
    "policy_info": {
      "observation": {
        "state": { "cube": [0.0, 0.5, 0.0] },
        "language": "move the cube"
      },
      "mode": "select_action"
    }
  }
}
```

Omitted fields keep deterministic defaults. A `transfer_clip.path` is resolved relative to the
input JSON file; use `frames_base64` instead of `path` when the clip bytes must be contained
inside the JSON fixture.

The same provider-operation runner is available from TheWorldHarness:

```bash
uv run --extra harness worldforge-harness --flow benchmark
```

The TUI streams per-sample latency while the run is active, then writes the canonical JSON report
under `.worldforge/reports/` and opens it in the Run Inspector. Treat those reports like CLI
benchmark artifacts: cite numbers only when the JSON behind them is preserved.

Use a budget file when a benchmark run is part of a release gate, regression check, or public
claim. Budget selectors can pin a provider and operation, or omit either field to apply the
threshold to every matching result:

```json
{
  "budgets": [
    {
      "provider": "mock",
      "operation": "generate",
      "min_success_rate": 1.0,
      "max_error_count": 0,
      "max_retry_count": 0,
      "max_average_latency_ms": 250.0,
      "max_p95_latency_ms": 400.0,
      "min_throughput_per_second": 2.0
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
uv run worldforge benchmark \
  --provider mock \
  --operation generate \
  --iterations 5 \
  --format json \
  --budget-file examples/benchmark-budget.json
```

With `--budget-file`, the command prints both the benchmark report and a gate report. A failing gate
exits non-zero after printing violations such as latency, retry, error-count, success-rate, or
unmatched-budget checks. JSON output contains `benchmark` and `gate` objects; Markdown prints both
reports; CSV prints the gate violation table.

## Report contents

- per-provider, per-operation success and error counts
- retry totals derived from emitted `ProviderEvent` records
- total wall-clock time and throughput
- average, min/max, p50, and p95 latency
- serialized provider-operation event aggregates for deeper inspection
- optional budget-gate results for release or claim-oriented thresholds

Every JSON and Markdown report includes `claim_boundary` and `metric_semantics` fields. The
benchmark harness is synthetic. It measures operation latency, retries, and throughput for the
selected provider adapter path; it does not score media quality, physical fidelity, safety, or
production load capacity.
