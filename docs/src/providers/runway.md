# Runway Provider

Capabilities: `generate`, `transfer`

Taxonomy category: remote video generation and transformation adapter

`runway` is an HTTP adapter for Runway's image-to-video, text-to-video-compatible, video-to-video,
and task-polling APIs. It creates a task, polls until completion, downloads the first output, and
returns a validated `VideoClip`.

```text
prompt/options or input VideoClip
  -> Runway task creation
  -> task polling
  -> artifact download
  -> VideoClip
```

WorldForge treats Runway as a media provider. It does not expose `predict`, `score`, or `policy`
because the adapter does not return a validated WorldForge state transition, action cost, or
executable action chunk.

## Runtime Ownership

WorldForge owns request shaping, typed timeout/retry policy, task response validation, artifact
download validation, and provider events.

The host owns:

- Runway credentials
- endpoint policy and API limits
- prompt/media inputs
- artifact retention after URLs expire
- operational telemetry and usage limits

## Configuration

- `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET`: preferred credential for auto-registration.
- `RUNWAY_API_SECRET`: legacy credential alias.
- `RUNWAYML_BASE_URL`: optional API endpoint override; defaults to
  `https://api.dev.runwayml.com`.

Programmatic construction:

```python
from worldforge.providers import RunwayProvider

provider = RunwayProvider(
    poll_interval_seconds=6.0,
    max_polls=60,
)
```

## Generate Contract

```python
from worldforge import GenerationOptions

clip = forge.generate(
    "a lab robot moves a cube",
    provider="runway",
    duration_seconds=5.0,
    options=GenerationOptions(
        image="/path/to/initial-frame.png",
        ratio="1280:720",
        model="gen4.5",
        seed=7,
    ),
)
```

Generation rules:

- `duration_seconds` must be greater than 0.
- Duration is mapped into Runway's 2-10 second request range.
- `GenerationOptions.ratio` must use `WIDTH:HEIGHT` with positive integer dimensions.
- `options.video` is rejected for `generate(...)`; use `transfer(...)` for video inputs.
- `image`, when supplied, becomes `promptImage`.
- `extras` are forwarded into the task-creation payload.

## Transfer Contract

```python
transferred = forge.transfer(
    clip,
    provider="runway",
    width=1280,
    height=720,
    fps=24,
    prompt="Re-render the clip with better lighting while preserving motion.",
    options=GenerationOptions(reference_images=["/path/to/reference.png"]),
)
```

Transfer rules:

- `width`, `height`, and `fps` must be greater than 0.
- Input video is supplied from `options.video` when provided, otherwise from the source
  `VideoClip`.
- `reference_images` become Runway references.
- The default transfer model is `gen4_aleph` unless `options.model` is supplied.

## Task And Artifact Contract

Runway task creation responses must include a non-empty task `id`.

Task polling responses must include:

- non-empty `status`
- matching task `id` when an id is returned
- `output` as a list of non-empty URLs when the task succeeds

Terminal task behavior:

- `SUCCEEDED`: download the first output URL
- `FAILED` or `CANCELLED`: raise `ProviderError` with returned failure detail
- timeout after `max_polls`: raise `ProviderError`

Artifact downloads accept video content types and `application/octet-stream`. Explicit non-video
content types such as `text/html` are rejected. Empty downloads fail explicitly. Expired or
unavailable artifact URLs are surfaced as provider errors.

## Request Policy

`RunwayProvider` uses `ProviderRequestPolicy.remote_defaults(...)`:

- task creation requests are single-attempt by default
- health checks, polling, and downloads retry with backoff
- the request timeout defaults to 120 seconds unless overridden

Pass a custom `request_policy=` when the host needs different timeout or retry behavior.

## Failure Modes

- Missing `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` and `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` leaves the provider unregistered.
- Organization health checks fail when credentials are invalid or the payload lacks both `id` and
  `name`.
- Task creation fails when the response lacks a non-empty task id.
- Polling fails when status payloads are malformed or the response id does not match the requested
  task.
- Completed tasks without output URLs fail explicitly.
- Expired, unavailable, empty, or wrong-content-type artifacts fail before returning `VideoClip`.
- Invalid ratios, durations, dimensions, FPS, polling intervals, or poll counts fail before or
  during request construction.

## Tests

- `tests/test_remote_video_providers.py` covers organization parsing, task creation and polling,
  failed tasks, partial outputs, expired artifacts, content-type rejection, transfer behavior, and
  input validation.
- `tests/fixtures/providers/runway_*.json` stores task and organization response fixtures.
