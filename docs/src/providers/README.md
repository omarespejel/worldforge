# Providers

WorldForge providers are capability adapters. A provider page should explain what the adapter can
actually do, what the host must supply, what WorldForge validates, and which failure modes callers
should expect.

Provider discovery and auto-registration policy live in `src/worldforge/providers/catalog.py`.
Keep this page and the provider pages aligned with that catalog.

## Provider Catalog

| Provider | Capability surface | Registration | Runtime ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mock` | `predict`, `generate`, `transfer`, `reason`, `embed`, `plan` | always registered | in-repo deterministic local provider |
| [`cosmos`](./cosmos.md) | `generate` | `COSMOS_BASE_URL` | host supplies a reachable Cosmos deployment and optional `NVIDIA_API_KEY` |
| [`runway`](./runway.md) | `generate`, `transfer` | `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` or `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` | host supplies Runway credentials and persists returned artifacts |
| [`leworldmodel`](./leworldmodel.md) | `score` | `LEWORLDMODEL_POLICY` or `LEWM_POLICY` | host installs `stable_worldmodel`, torch, and compatible checkpoints |
| [`gr00t`](./gr00t.md) | `policy` | `GROOT_POLICY_HOST` | host runs or reaches an Isaac GR00T policy server |
| [`lerobot`](./lerobot.md) | `policy` | `LEROBOT_POLICY_PATH` or `LEROBOT_POLICY` | host installs LeRobot and compatible policy checkpoints |
| `jepa` | scaffold | `JEPA_MODEL_PATH` | credential-gated mock-backed reservation, not a real JEPA runtime |
| `genie` | scaffold | `GENIE_API_KEY` | credential-gated mock-backed reservation, not a real Genie runtime |

## Candidate Scaffolds

| Provider | Capability surface | Registration | Runtime ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`jepa-wms`](./jepa-wms.md) | direct-construction `score` candidate | none | host-owned torch-hub/runtime experiment; not exported or auto-registered |

Candidate scaffolds stay outside package exports and auto-registration until the runtime adapter,
limits, parser coverage, docs, and smoke path are credible enough for callers to depend on.

## Capability Model

WorldForge does not treat provider capabilities as badges. They are callable contracts.

| Capability | Provider method | Result contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `predict` | `predict(world_state, action, steps)` | `PredictionPayload` |
| `generate` | `generate(prompt, duration_seconds, options)` | `VideoClip` |
| `transfer` | `transfer(clip, width, height, fps, prompt, options)` | `VideoClip` |
| `reason` | `reason(query, world_state)` | `ReasoningResult` |
| `embed` | `embed(text=...)` | `EmbeddingResult` |
| `score` | `score_actions(info, action_candidates)` | `ActionScoreResult` |
| `policy` | `select_actions(info)` | `ActionPolicyResult` |

Rules:

- Do not advertise a capability unless the adapter implements the method end to end.
- Do not expose `predict` for a model that only returns latent costs.
- Do not expose `policy` unless raw actions are translated into executable WorldForge `Action`
  objects.
- Do not expose `generate` or `transfer` unless the returned media is validated as a `VideoClip`.
- Keep scaffold providers obvious: they reserve names and contracts without claiming runtime
  support.

## Provider Profiles

Every provider exposes a `ProviderProfile` for routing, diagnostics, and documentation:

- capability surface derived from `ProviderCapabilities`
- local versus remote runtime
- deterministic versus stochastic behavior
- implementation maturity such as `stable`, `beta`, `experimental`, or `scaffold`
- required environment variables
- supported modalities and artifact types
- request policy for HTTP-backed providers
- maintainer notes for caveats

Python:

```python
from worldforge import WorldForge

forge = WorldForge()
profile = forge.provider_profile("leworldmodel")
doctor = forge.doctor()

print(profile.supported_tasks)
print(doctor.issues)
```

CLI:

```bash
uv run worldforge provider list
uv run worldforge provider info leworldmodel
uv run worldforge doctor
uv run worldforge doctor --capability score
```

`doctor()` includes known but unregistered optional providers by default. That makes missing
configuration visible before a workflow fails. Use `--registered-only` when a process needs to
check only the providers enabled for that process.

## Runtime Ownership

WorldForge owns:

- provider registration and profile metadata
- typed input and output validation
- local JSON world persistence
- planning composition across `predict`, `score`, and `policy`
- deterministic evaluation and benchmark harnesses
- provider event hooks

The host owns:

- credentials and endpoint reachability
- torch, LeWorldModel, LeRobot, Isaac GR00T, CUDA, TensorRT, checkpoints, datasets, and robot
  runtimes
- observation preprocessing into model-native tensors
- embodiment-specific action translation
- operational telemetry, trace IDs, dashboards, and alerts
- durable persistence and artifact retention

## Observability

HTTP adapters emit `ProviderEvent` records for retries, successes, and failures. Local score and
policy adapters emit success and failure events around the model boundary where supported.

Attach sinks through `WorldForge(event_handler=...)`:

```python
import logging

from worldforge import WorldForge
from worldforge.observability import JsonLoggerSink, ProviderMetricsSink, compose_event_handlers

metrics = ProviderMetricsSink()
forge = WorldForge(
    event_handler=compose_event_handlers(
        JsonLoggerSink(logger=logging.getLogger("demo.worldforge")),
        metrics,
    )
)
```

`ProviderMetricsSink.request_count` counts emitted provider events, so retry events increment both
`request_count` and `retry_count`.

## Authoring Standard

Before adding or promoting a provider, document:

- taxonomy category and capability surface
- configuration and auto-registration rule
- host-owned dependencies
- input shape and range constraints
- output schema and score direction, if any
- retry, timeout, polling, and artifact behavior
- failure modes
- fixture coverage and smoke path

See [Provider Authoring Guide](../provider-authoring-guide.md) for the implementation checklist.
