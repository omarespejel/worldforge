# Providers

WorldForge providers are capability adapters, not a claim that every upstream system uses the same
definition of "world model." See [World Model Taxonomy](../world-model-taxonomy.md) for the project
definition, [Architecture](../architecture.md) for the end-to-end provider injection pipeline, and
[Provider Authoring Guide](../provider-authoring-guide.md) before adding a new adapter.

## In-repo providers

| Provider | Status | Auto-registration rule | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mock` | stable | always registered | deterministic local provider used by tests, examples, framework development, and adapter contract checks |
| `cosmos` | beta | register when `COSMOS_BASE_URL` is set | real HTTP adapter for Cosmos NIM; `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is optional and sent as bearer auth when present |
| `runway` | beta | register when `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` or `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` is set | real HTTP adapter for Runway image-to-video and video-to-video APIs |
| `leworldmodel` | beta | register when `LEWORLDMODEL_POLICY` or `LEWM_POLICY` is set | real optional adapter for LeWorldModel JEPA cost models through `stable_worldmodel.policy.AutoCostModel` |
| [`gr00t`](./gr00t.md) | experimental | register when `GROOT_POLICY_HOST` is set | host-owned NVIDIA Isaac GR00T PolicyClient adapter for embodied action selection |
| [`lerobot`](./lerobot.md) | beta | register when `LEROBOT_POLICY_PATH` or `LEROBOT_POLICY` is set | host-owned Hugging Face LeRobot `PreTrainedPolicy` adapter for embodied action selection |
| `jepa` | scaffold | register when `JEPA_MODEL_PATH` is set | credential-gated stub backed by deterministic mock behavior |
| `genie` | scaffold | register when `GENIE_API_KEY` is set | credential-gated stub backed by deterministic mock behavior |

## Provider candidate scaffolds

Candidate scaffolds are source files kept outside package exports and auto-registration until they
have a real runtime adapter, typed parser coverage, provider-specific limits, and API docs. They
exist to make future integrations explicit without claiming runtime support.

| Provider | Status | Registration rule | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`jepa-wms`](./jepa-wms.md) | scaffold candidate | none; not exported or registered | local candidate with fake-runtime and host-owned torch-hub `score` contract tests for future `facebookresearch/jepa-wms` integration |

## Provider profiles

Every provider exposes a profile describing:

- supported task surface derived from capabilities
- deterministic vs stochastic behavior
- local vs remote runtime
- implementation status such as `stable`, `beta`, or `scaffold`
- credential requirements and environment variables
- supported modalities and artifact types
- maintainer notes for caveats

Programmatically:

```python
import logging

from worldforge import WorldForge
from worldforge.observability import (
    InMemoryRecorderSink,
    JsonLoggerSink,
    ProviderMetricsSink,
    compose_event_handlers,
)

logger = logging.getLogger("demo.worldforge")
metrics = ProviderMetricsSink()
recorder = InMemoryRecorderSink()

forge = WorldForge(
    event_handler=compose_event_handlers(
        JsonLoggerSink(logger=logger),
        metrics,
        recorder,
    )
)
profile = forge.provider_profile("mock")
forge.generate("orbiting cube", "mock", duration_seconds=1.0)

print(profile.supported_tasks, profile.deterministic)
print(metrics.get("mock", "generate").to_dict())
print(recorder.snapshot()[0].phase)
```

From the CLI:

```bash
uv run worldforge provider list
uv run worldforge provider info mock
uv run worldforge doctor
```

## Capability model

Providers can declare support for:

- `predict`
- `generate`
- `reason`
- `embed`
- `plan`
- `transfer`
- `score`
- `policy`

`score` providers return `ActionScoreResult` from `score_actions(...)`. The result contains the
provider name, one score per candidate, `best_index`, `best_score`, and explicit score direction.
For `leworldmodel`, scores are costs and lower values are better. `World.plan(...)` serializes
WorldForge action candidates for scoring by default; hosts can pass provider-native tensors through
`score_action_candidates` when an adapter needs them.

`policy` providers return `ActionPolicyResult` from `select_actions(...)`. The result preserves raw
provider actions, selected WorldForge actions, candidate action chunks, embodiment metadata, and
provider-native info. `gr00t` and `lerobot` both use this surface because Isaac GR00T and Hugging
Face LeRobot are embodied action policies, not future-state predictors.

LeWorldModel is the architectural reference provider for score-based planning. It is first class
because it matches the JEPA planning contract WorldForge is designed to support: observations,
goals, and action candidates in; ranked futures out. WorldForge therefore models it as `score`
instead of pretending it can generate video, reason over text, or mutate world state directly.

## Operational notes

- `doctor()` includes known providers by default so missing configuration shows up in diagnostics.
- Missing local asset paths now fail before the outbound request instead of being treated as opaque remote strings.
- `cosmos` and `runway` expose a typed `ProviderRequestPolicy` through `provider_profile()` and CLI JSON output.
- `cosmos` validates health and generation response payloads before decoding generated video bytes.
- `runway` validates organization, task creation, task polling, task output, artifact content type, and expired artifact responses before returning a `VideoClip`.
- `leworldmodel` validates required `pixels`, `goal`, and `action` fields plus four-dimensional
  action-candidate payloads before invoking the cost model.
- `gr00t` validates policy observations, preserves raw policy actions, and requires a host-owned
  action translator before returning executable WorldForge actions.
- `lerobot` validates policy observations, preserves raw policy actions, lazily loads
  `lerobot.policies.pretrained.PreTrainedPolicy`, and requires a host-owned action translator
  before returning executable WorldForge actions.
- Health checks, polling, and downloads retry with backoff by default. Create-style POST requests remain single-attempt unless a caller passes a custom policy.
- `WorldForge(event_handler=...)` and provider constructor `event_handler=` arguments accept a `ProviderEvent` callback for host-side logging and metrics.
- `worldforge.observability.compose_event_handlers(...)` lets host apps attach multiple sinks without writing a custom dispatcher.
- `ProviderMetricsSink.request_count` counts emitted request attempts, so retry events increment both `request_count` and `retry_count`.
- `cosmos` and `runway` emit `retry`, `success`, and `failure` events for HTTP operations.
  `leworldmodel` emits `success` and `failure` events for local scoring. `mock`, `jepa`, and
  `genie` emit success events for local provider operations.
- `cosmos` and `runway` are the only in-repo adapters that currently perform real HTTP requests.

## Provider-specific limits

Cosmos:

- `duration_seconds` must be greater than 0.
- Output width and height resolved from `GenerationOptions.size` or `GenerationOptions.ratio`
  must be greater than 0 and multiples of 8.
- `fps` must be greater than 0.
- `b64_video` must be a non-empty base64 string.
- Optional `seed` must be an integer when returned by the upstream API.

Runway:

- `duration_seconds` must be greater than 0. WorldForge maps accepted values into Runway's
  2-10 second request range for the current image-to-video endpoint.
- `GenerationOptions.ratio` must use `WIDTH:HEIGHT` with positive integer dimensions.
- `transfer(...)` output `width`, `height`, and `fps` must be greater than 0.
- `poll_interval_seconds` must be non-negative and `max_polls` must be greater than 0.
- Task responses must include a non-empty string `id` when creating tasks and a non-empty string
  `status` when polling tasks.
- Succeeded tasks must include at least one non-empty output URL.
- Downloaded artifacts reject explicit non-video content types such as `text/html`.

LeWorldModel:

- `LEWORLDMODEL_POLICY` or `LEWM_POLICY` must be the checkpoint run name relative to
  `$STABLEWM_HOME`, without the `_object.ckpt` suffix.
- `stable_worldmodel` and `torch` are optional host dependencies and are imported only when the
  provider is configured or used.
- `info` must include `pixels`, `goal`, and `action` as tensors or rectangular nested numeric
  sequences with at least three dimensions.
- `action_candidates` must be a tensor or rectangular nested numeric sequence shaped as
  `(batch, samples, horizon, action_dim)`.
- Model output must flatten to at least one finite numeric score.
- `uv run --python 3.10 --with "stable-worldmodel[train,env]" worldforge-smoke-leworldmodel`
  can run a local end-to-end smoke against `quentinll/lewm-pusht`. This is the real checkpoint
  path: it requires an extracted object checkpoint such as `~/.stable-wm/pusht/lewm_object.ckpt`,
  builds synthetic task-shaped tensors, and runs upstream LeWorldModel scoring through
  `LeWorldModelProvider`.
- `uv run worldforge-demo-leworldmodel` is the checkout-safe walkthrough for the same public
  provider surface. It injects a deterministic LeWorldModel-compatible runtime, scores candidate
  action tensors, selects a plan, executes it through `mock`, persists the result, and reloads it.
  It uses the real `LeWorldModelProvider` and score-planning pipeline, but it does not load an
  upstream LeWorldModel checkpoint or run neural inference.
  `predicted_states` is empty in that demo because the provider returns costs for candidate action
  sequences; the selected WorldForge actions are applied later by the execution provider.

GR00T:

- `GROOT_POLICY_HOST` points at a running Isaac GR00T policy server.
- `GROOT_POLICY_PORT` defaults to `5555`; `GROOT_POLICY_TIMEOUT_MS` defaults to `15000`.
- `GROOT_POLICY_API_TOKEN`, `GROOT_POLICY_STRICT`, and `GROOT_EMBODIMENT_TAG` are optional.
- The adapter lazily imports `gr00t.policy.server_client.PolicyClient` only when a non-injected
  client is used.
- `info["observation"]` must be a JSON object containing at least one of `video`, `state`, or
  `language`.
- A host-supplied `action_translator` maps GR00T's embodiment-specific raw actions to WorldForge
  `Action` objects.
- `scripts/smoke_gr00t_policy.py` can connect to an existing policy server or launch
  `gr00t/eval/run_gr00t_server.py` from a local Isaac-GR00T checkout for a live PolicyClient
  smoke.
- The latest local live-smoke attempt could not run upstream Isaac-GR00T on macOS arm64 because
  CUDA/TensorRT packages such as `tensorrt-cu13-libs` require a compatible NVIDIA/Linux runtime.

LeRobot:

- `LEROBOT_POLICY_PATH` (alias `LEROBOT_POLICY`) is the Hugging Face repo id or local checkpoint
  directory for a LeRobot `PreTrainedPolicy`.
- `LEROBOT_POLICY_TYPE` optionally pins a specific policy class such as `act`, `diffusion`,
  `tdmpc`, `vqbet`, `pi0`, `pi0fast`, `sac`, or `smolvla`.
- `LEROBOT_DEVICE`, `LEROBOT_CACHE_DIR`, and `LEROBOT_EMBODIMENT_TAG` are optional.
- The adapter lazily imports `lerobot.policies.pretrained.PreTrainedPolicy` only when a
  non-injected policy is loaded.
- `info["observation"]` must be a non-empty JSON object; keys follow LeRobot's naming
  conventions (`observation.state`, `observation.images.<camera>`, `task`, ...).
- `info["mode"]` picks between `select_action` (single-step) and `predict_chunk` (full action
  chunk, only available when the policy implements `predict_action_chunk`).
- A host-supplied `action_translator` maps LeRobot's embodiment-specific raw action tensors to
  WorldForge `Action` objects, optionally as multiple candidate chunks.
- `examples/lerobot_e2e_demo.py` runs a checkout-safe end-to-end demo of the real provider
  with an injected deterministic policy.
- `scripts/smoke_lerobot_policy.py` loads a real LeRobot checkpoint via `PreTrainedPolicy`
  and runs a live policy smoke; it requires `lerobot` and any robot-specific dependencies in
  the host environment.
