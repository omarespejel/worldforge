# GR00T Provider

Capability: `policy`

Taxonomy category: embodied policy / VLA action model

`gr00t` wraps NVIDIA Isaac GR00T's policy-client shape. GR00T is modeled as an actor: it accepts
multimodal observations and language instructions, then returns robot action chunks. It is not
modeled as a predictive world model, video generator, or candidate scorer.

```text
observation + language instruction
  -> GR00T policy client
  -> raw embodiment-specific action arrays
  -> host action_translator
  -> ActionPolicyResult
```

## Runtime Ownership

WorldForge owns provider registration, observation envelope validation, raw-action preservation,
action-result validation, planning composition, and provider events.

The host owns:

- Isaac GR00T installation and dependencies
- reachable policy server
- model checkpoints and robot-specific runtime setup
- observations from sensors, simulator, or logs
- translation from raw policy arrays to WorldForge `Action` objects
- robot execution, safety interlocks, and controller integration

WorldForge never drives hardware directly.

## Configuration

- `GROOT_POLICY_HOST`: required for auto-registration. Hostname or IP of a running GR00T policy
  server.
- `GROOT_POLICY_PORT`: optional, defaults to `5555`.
- `GROOT_POLICY_TIMEOUT_MS`: optional, defaults to `15000`.
- `GROOT_POLICY_API_TOKEN`: optional token passed to the policy client.
- `GROOT_POLICY_STRICT`: optional boolean, defaults to `false`.
- `GROOT_EMBODIMENT_TAG`: optional metadata for the robot embodiment.

The adapter does not add Isaac GR00T, PyTorch, CUDA, TensorRT, checkpoints, or robot runtime
dependencies to WorldForge's base install.

## Runtime Contract

Direct construction with a fake or host-owned client:

```python
from worldforge.providers import GrootPolicyClientProvider

provider = GrootPolicyClientProvider(
    policy_client=client,
    embodiment_tag="LIBERO_PANDA",
    action_translator=translate_actions,
)
```

The injected or lazily created client must expose:

```python
get_action(observation, options=None) -> actions | (actions, info)
```

Without an injected client, WorldForge lazily imports:

```python
from gr00t.policy.server_client import PolicyClient
```

and creates a client from `GROOT_POLICY_*` settings.

## Input Contract

```python
result = forge.select_actions(
    "gr00t",
    info={
        "observation": {
            "video": {"front": video_array},
            "state": {"eef": state_array},
            "language": {"task": [["pick up the cube"]]},
        },
        "embodiment_tag": "LIBERO_PANDA",
        "action_horizon": 16,
        "options": {},
    },
)
```

Validation rules:

- `info["observation"]` must be a JSON object.
- Observation must include at least one of `video`, `state`, or `language`.
- `options`, when supplied, must be a JSON object.
- Tensor-like values with `tolist()` are normalized for metadata and raw-action preservation.
- A host-supplied `action_translator` is required before `ActionPolicyResult` can be returned.

## Action Translation

GR00T actions are embodiment-specific physical action arrays. WorldForge cannot infer joint
meaning, gripper semantics, controller timing, or coordinate frames. The translator owns that
mapping:

```python
from worldforge import Action

def translate_actions(raw_actions, info, provider_info):
    return [
        Action.move_to(0.3, 0.5, 0.0),
        Action.move_to(0.4, 0.5, 0.0),
    ]
```

The translator may return:

- a single action chunk: `[Action.move_to(...), Action.move_to(...)]`
- multiple candidate chunks: `[[Action.move_to(...)], [Action.move_to(...)] ]`

Multiple candidates are useful for policy-plus-score planning.

## Planning

Policy-only planning:

```python
plan = world.plan(
    goal="pick up the cube",
    provider="gr00t",
    policy_info=policy_info,
    execution_provider="mock",
)
```

Policy plus score planning:

```python
plan = world.plan(
    goal="choose the lowest-cost policy candidate",
    policy_provider="gr00t",
    score_provider="leworldmodel",
    policy_info=policy_info,
    score_info=lewm_info,
    execution_provider="mock",
)
```

WorldForge serializes policy candidates into `Action.to_dict()` payloads before calling the score
provider unless `score_action_candidates=...` supplies model-native candidates.

## Live Smoke

Connect to an existing GR00T policy server:

```bash
GROOT_POLICY_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
GROOT_POLICY_PORT=5555 \
uv run python scripts/smoke_gr00t_policy.py \
  --policy-info-json /path/to/policy_info.json \
  --translator /path/to/translator.py:translate_actions
```

Launch the upstream server from a host-owned Isaac-GR00T checkout:

```bash
uv run python scripts/smoke_gr00t_policy.py \
  --start-server \
  --gr00t-root /path/to/Isaac-GR00T \
  --model-path nvidia/GR00T-N1.6-3B \
  --embodiment-tag GR1 \
  --policy-info-json /path/to/policy_info.json \
  --translator /path/to/translator.py:translate_actions
```

Launching upstream Isaac GR00T requires a compatible NVIDIA/Linux runtime for CUDA and TensorRT
dependencies. On unsupported hosts, connect WorldForge to an already running remote policy server.

## Failure Modes

- Missing `GROOT_POLICY_HOST` leaves the provider unregistered.
- Missing `gr00t.policy.server_client.PolicyClient` is reported by `health()`.
- Missing `action_translator` fails with `ProviderError`.
- Malformed observations fail before invoking the policy client.
- Non-JSON-compatible raw actions or provider info fail before returning `ActionPolicyResult`.
- Failed policy inference is wrapped in `ProviderError`.
- Launching the upstream server on an unsupported host can fail before WorldForge can connect.
- Policy-plus-score planning fails if the score provider selects an index outside the policy
  candidate list.

## Tests

- `tests/test_gr00t_provider.py` covers fake-client contract checks, event emission, malformed
  inputs, missing translator, health failures, policy-only planning, and policy-plus-score
  planning.
- `tests/test_gr00t_smoke_script.py` covers smoke-script input loading and server preflight
  validation without requiring Isaac GR00T or a GPU.
