# Operations

WorldForge is a Python library plus CLI. Operational responsibility lives in the host application
that imports it. This page documents the runtime assumptions and minimum runbook for teams using
WorldForge in services, jobs, or provider-evaluation pipelines.

## Configuration

Configuration comes from constructor arguments and environment variables documented in
`.env.example`.

- `COSMOS_BASE_URL` enables the Cosmos adapter.
- `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is optional bearer auth for Cosmos.
- `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` enables the Runway adapter.
- `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` remains supported as the legacy Runway alias.
- `RUNWAYML_BASE_URL` overrides the default Runway API endpoint.
- `LEWORLDMODEL_POLICY` or `LEWM_POLICY` enables the optional LeWorldModel adapter.
- `LEWORLDMODEL_CACHE_DIR` overrides the LeWorldModel checkpoint root.
- `LEWORLDMODEL_DEVICE` selects the optional torch device for LeWorldModel scoring.
- `GROOT_POLICY_HOST` enables the optional GR00T embodied-policy adapter.
- `GROOT_POLICY_PORT` defaults to `5555`.
- `GROOT_POLICY_TIMEOUT_MS` defaults to `15000`.
- `GROOT_POLICY_API_TOKEN`, `GROOT_POLICY_STRICT`, and `GROOT_EMBODIMENT_TAG` are optional GR00T
  PolicyClient settings.
- `JEPA_MODEL_PATH` and `GENIE_API_KEY` enable scaffold adapters only.

Validate configuration at startup with:

```bash
uv run worldforge doctor --registered-only
uv run worldforge provider health
```

## Persistence

World state is persisted as local JSON under `.worldforge/worlds` by default or under the
`state_dir` passed to `WorldForge`.

This store is suitable for local development, tests, examples, and single-writer workflows. It is
not a concurrent database. Services that need multi-writer persistence should store exported world
payloads in their own database and apply their own locking, backup, and retention policy.

Persistence decision for the Provider Hardening RC: persistence remains explicitly host-owned.
WorldForge will continue to provide deterministic local JSON import/export and validation, but it
will not add a library-owned lock file, SQLite store, or network database adapter in this milestone.
The reason is boundary clarity: host applications already own deployment topology, durability,
locking semantics, backup policy, and retention requirements. WorldForge should not imply
production durability guarantees that a local JSON store cannot enforce.

Release-candidate exit criteria for persistence:

- Local JSON imports reject malformed scene object IDs, non-object state payloads, invalid
  metadata, invalid history, and negative steps.
- README and operations docs state that multi-writer persistence is host-owned.
- Any future built-in persistence backend must be introduced as an explicit adapter with its own
  locking, migration, and recovery documentation.

## Observability

Attach a provider event handler at `WorldForge(event_handler=...)` or provider construction time.
Use `compose_event_handlers(...)` to fan out events to:

- `JsonLoggerSink` for structured JSON logs.
- `ProviderMetricsSink` for request, retry, error, and latency aggregates.
- `InMemoryRecorderSink` for tests and local debugging.

Host services should add request or trace IDs through `JsonLoggerSink(extra_fields=...)` and
include those IDs in surrounding application logs.

## Failure Modes

- Invalid caller input raises `WorldForgeError`.
- Malformed persisted or provider-supplied state raises `WorldStateError`.
- Provider runtime, transport, credential, and upstream failures raise `ProviderError`.
- Missing remote credentials leave the provider unregistered unless inspected through
  `doctor()`.
- Remote create-style requests are single-attempt by default; health checks, polling, and
  downloads retry according to `ProviderRequestPolicy`.
- Cosmos and Runway validate typed upstream response payloads before creating returned media
  objects.
- Runway artifact downloads fail explicitly on expired/unavailable URLs, empty downloads, and
  explicit unsupported content types.
- LeWorldModel scoring fails explicitly when optional dependencies are unavailable, the checkpoint
  cannot load, required `pixels` / `goal` / `action` fields are missing, action candidates are not
  four-dimensional, or returned scores are not finite.
- GR00T policy selection fails explicitly when the PolicyClient dependency is unavailable, the
  policy server is unreachable, observations are malformed, raw actions are not JSON-compatible,
  or no host-owned action translator is provided.

## Recovery

- For local state corruption, restore from the host application's backup of exported world JSON.
- For missing credentials, fix the environment and restart the host process so provider
  auto-registration runs again.
- For transient remote failures, inspect emitted `ProviderEvent` records for `operation`,
  `phase`, `status_code`, `attempt`, and `target`.
- For expired Runway artifact URLs, regenerate or persist downloaded outputs immediately after
  task completion.
- For LeWorldModel failures, run `worldforge provider health leworldmodel`, verify
  `stable-worldmodel[env]` and `torch` are installed in the host environment, then confirm the
  configured policy exists under `$STABLEWM_HOME` or `LEWORLDMODEL_CACHE_DIR`.
- To smoke-test a real LeWorldModel checkpoint, install the upstream
  `stable-worldmodel[train,env]` runtime in an isolated environment and run
  `python scripts/smoke_leworldmodel.py --stablewm-home /path/to/stablewm-home`.
- To smoke-test a real GR00T policy server, install or check out NVIDIA Isaac-GR00T, prepare a
  host-specific observation factory and action translator, then run
  `python scripts/smoke_gr00t_policy.py --gr00t-root /path/to/Isaac-GR00T --start-server ...`.
  The script can also connect to an existing server with `GROOT_POLICY_HOST` and
  `--policy-info-json` or `--observation-module`.
- The 2026-04-17 local GR00T live-smoke attempt failed on macOS arm64 because upstream
  Isaac-GR00T depends on CUDA/TensorRT packages such as `tensorrt-cu13-libs`; no compatible wheel
  or NVIDIA driver runtime was available. Use a Linux NVIDIA GPU host, or point WorldForge at an
  already running remote GR00T policy server.

## Release Checklist

Before publishing a release:

```bash
uv lock --check
uv run ruff check src tests examples scripts
uv run ruff format --check src tests examples scripts
uv run pytest --cov=src/worldforge --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90
bash scripts/test_package.sh
```

Also update `CHANGELOG.md`, README status, and provider documentation for any public behavior
change.

## Provider Hardening RC Exit Criteria

- Cosmos and Runway response parsers cover success and malformed upstream payloads with fixture
  tests.
- Remote provider non-happy-path tests cover transport retries, malformed JSON, missing task IDs,
  failed tasks, partial outputs, expired artifacts, bad artifact content types, and provider
  limits.
- Persistence remains documented as host-owned unless a dedicated persistence adapter is designed.
- API documentation lists the public exception families and provider workflow failure modes.
- Remaining work is tracked in GitHub issues with severity labels and measurable exit criteria.
