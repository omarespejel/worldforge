Key directories:

- `src/worldforge/`
- `src/worldforge/testing/`
- `tests/`
- `examples/`

Provider work belongs in `src/worldforge/providers/`. Keep adapter capabilities honest and add tests for every new supported path.

For adapter packages and in-repo providers, use the reusable contract helper:

```python
from worldforge.testing import assert_provider_contract

report = assert_provider_contract(provider)
print(report.exercised_operations)
```
