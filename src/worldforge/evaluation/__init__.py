"""Deterministic evaluation suites for WorldForge providers.

The evaluation package bundles five built-in suites — ``generation``, ``physics``,
``planning``, ``reasoning``, and ``transfer`` — that exercise a provider's typed surfaces
through fixed scenarios and capture results as :class:`EvaluationReport` payloads. Construct
suites via :meth:`EvaluationSuite.from_builtin` (the primary entry point) or assemble custom
:class:`EvaluationScenario` sequences.

The suites are **adapter-contract checks, not physical-fidelity benchmarks**. A passing score
asserts the provider returns well-formed payloads under the documented inputs; it is not
evidence of physical realism, media quality, or task success on real hardware. The
``EvalReport``/``EvalResult``/``EvalScenario``/``EvalSuite`` aliases are kept for backwards
compatibility and resolve to the same classes.
