# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to WorldForge are recorded here.

This project follows the spirit of Keep a Changelog. Versioning is currently pre-1.0, so minor
releases may still include breaking changes when the public API needs to tighten.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a public-API snapshot test. `tests/fixtures/public_api/exports.json`
  records the current export set for `worldforge`, `worldforge.testing`,
  `worldforge.observability`, `worldforge.providers`, and
  `worldforge.capabilities`; `tests/test_public_api_snapshot.py` fails loudly
  on any add/rename/remove with a clear diff and the regenerate command.
  Intentional public-API changes regenerate the snapshot via
  `uv run python scripts/update_public_api_snapshot.py` or by setting
  `WORLDFORGE_UPDATE_PUBLIC_API_SNAPSHOT=1`. `docs/src/api-stability.md`
  now points at the snapshot as the authoritative Stable surface.
- Added an adoption case-study gallery, reusable case-study template, Adoption Story issue
  template, and smoke tests for future submitted adoption stories.
- Added a runnable capability protocol mini-demo with docs and tests for in-process predictor,
  policy, and cost registration.
- Added a checkout-safe external provider package demo workflow. `scripts/demo_showcases.py run
  external-provider-package` generates a temp provider package, proves `worldforge.providers`
  entry-point discovery, disabled discovery, duplicate-name handling, and missing optional
  dependency skip reporting, and preserves a safe discovery report without publishing or mutating
  tracked source.
- Expanded the custom evaluation suite example into a checkout-safe walkthrough. The demo now runs a
  deterministic custom suite against `mock`, preserves JSON/Markdown/HTML/failure-gallery
  artifacts with provenance, and includes one controlled failed case for report review without
  claiming model quality.
- Added a checkout-safe policy+score candidate lab. The demo builds deterministic bounded move
  candidates, preserves raw policy actions, scores candidate plans, records the selected action and
  workflow trace, and captures invalid candidate bounds plus missing-translator failures without
  requiring a robot, simulator, or checkpoint.
- Added a checkout-safe fixture drift review walkthrough. The demo builds a temp fixture snapshot
  manifest, shows missing fixture, digest drift, schema-version drift, unsafe path, and
  intended-update review outputs, and preserves the approved update path without touching tracked
  fixtures.
- Added a checkout-safe capability negotiation preflight demo. The workflow preserves negotiation
  JSON/Markdown for ready, missing-config, missing-dependency, unsupported, and not-registered
  cases across generate, transfer, score, policy+score, and evaluation workflow shapes without
  installing dependencies or executing fallback workflows.
- Added a checkout-safe embodied policy replay comparison. It compares LeRobot, GR00T, and
  Cosmos-Policy policy contracts side by side, preserves provider-specific raw action metadata,
  records missing-translator blockers, and links each provider to its prepared-host live smoke.
- Added a scenario gallery under `examples/scenarios/` covering successful world setup,
  intentionally failed expectations, invalid action triage, evaluation-oriented setup, and
  report/export output through the existing `worldforge scenario` CLI.
- Added a checkout-safe release readiness drill script that renders clean-pass and controlled
  failure release-evidence artifacts, reports host-owned optional-runtime skips, and records the
  first failed gate without publishing, tagging, signing, or creating a release.
- Added a non-developer evidence review demo that builds a static HTML/JSON/Markdown review
  package from evaluation, benchmark, world-diff, and issue-bundle artifacts while escaping display
  text and marking unsafe host-local references as local-only.
- Added a provider failure mode gallery demo and docs page covering fixture-backed parser errors,
  provider errors, retry exhaustion, missing config, optional-runtime setup, scaffold boundaries,
  unsupported behavior, and safe artifact handling with first triage commands.
- Added typed provider lifecycle diagnostics with `ProviderLifecycleResult`,
  `ProviderLifecycleStatus`, optional provider-owned `preflight`, `warmup`, and `teardown` hooks,
  safe no-op/skipped defaults, protocol-wrapper support, and doctor/provider-info JSON output for
  lifecycle readiness and skip reasons.
- Added `worldforge runs compare --mode regression` for baseline-vs-candidate review across
  preserved benchmark, evaluation, and demo-showcase runs. Regression reports include metric
  deltas, budget status changes, new and removed failures, safe artifact drift, provenance
  differences, and unsafe artifact exclusion counts in JSON, Markdown, CSV, and HTML.
- Added scenario parameter matrices for bounded checkout-safe sweeps. Scenario files can now
  declare JSON-native `matrix.parameters`, use whole-value placeholders for provider names, object
  positions, action targets, and expected artifact values, validate every expanded case before
  execution, and return aggregate pass/fail counts plus failed-case details from
  `worldforge scenario run`.
- Added evaluation dataset manifest contracts. `worldforge eval --dataset-manifest <path>` now
  cites schema-versioned manifest references in provenance, with validation for local fixture
  paths, remote references, host-owned asset records, checksums, license/provenance/privacy/safety
  fields, and evidence-bundle copying of safe source-controlled manifest files without embedding
  datasets.
- Added `worldforge provider contract` for external adapter authors. It runs metadata and
  capability-aware provider contract checks for registered providers or direct `module:factory`
  paths, emits safe-to-attach JSON/Markdown evidence with skipped host-owned checks and validation
  commands, and keeps live provider calls behind an explicit `--live` flag.
- Added runtime asset manifests for prepared-host optional runtimes. LeWorldModel and
  LeRobot/LeWorldModel smoke outputs now include safe `runtime_assets` references in run manifests,
  while full local-only paths, cache roots, and checkpoint bytes stay out of attachable evidence.
- Added non-secret JSON/TOML configuration profiles for repeatable eval and benchmark CLI defaults.
  Profiles reject secret-looking keys and unsafe paths, and preserved run manifests now include
  safe `config_profile` provenance with the profile digest instead of profile contents.
- Added a safe report-renderer registry for comparison and evidence bundle artifacts. Built-in
  JSON/Markdown/CSV/HTML renderers keep their output unchanged, while external code can register
  validated safe-to-attach or local-only renderers without file-based plugin loading.
- Added read-only world migration previews through `worldforge world migration-preview`. The report
  covers persisted worlds and exported world JSON, schema versions, required canonicalization
  changes, invalid fields, unsafe IDs, bounding-box corrections, safe-to-attach status, and whether
  an explicit migration can be applied safely without silently rewriting local state.
- Added schema-versioned workflow trace artifacts for composed operations. Plans now include
  sanitized trace metadata, evaluation reports export trace JSON/Markdown and render trace tables
  in HTML, provider events can be converted into trace steps, and the optional Rerun artifact logger
  can record workflow traces without changing provider capability semantics.
- Added `docs/src/artifact-schemas.md`, an ownership and migration map for public and
  semi-public JSON artifact families. The page records each schema's owner, version field,
  validation surface, docs/CLI entry point, and migration rules, and the docs test suite now guards
  schema-version exports and required artifact families against missing ownership notes.
- Added `scripts/check_optional_import_boundaries.py`, a checkout-safe audit that statically checks
  optional runtime imports and verifies base package, CLI, Rerun, provider, and non-TUI harness
  imports do not load Textual, Rerun, torch, stable-worldmodel, LeRobot, GR00T, or Cosmos-Policy
  runtime packages.
- Added `scripts/check_docs_snippets.py`, a marker-based docs snippet gate for selected Python and
  JSON examples across the Python API, scenarios, provider routing, external provider,
  benchmarking, artifact, and report docs. The gate executes Python snippets in a temp workspace,
  parses JSON snippets, applies scenario and benchmark schema checks, and requires explicit
  host-owned, credentialed, or illustrative skip markers.
- Added `worldforge.testing` deterministic controls for artifact and report tests:
  `DeterministicClock`, `DeterministicIdFactory`, `deterministic_run_workspace`,
  `stable_snapshot`, `stable_path`, and `stable_json_dumps`. Evidence bundle generation, issue
  bundle tests, release evidence tests, preserved benchmark snapshots, scenario result snapshots,
  and live-smoke run manifest tests can now pin clocks, IDs, temp paths, volatile fields, and
  sorted JSON without weakening real runtime timing.
- Added a generated Provider Configuration Index that derives each catalog provider's required and
  optional inputs, optional packages, credential gates, prepared-host assets, default request
  timeouts, first diagnostic command, smoke command, and evidence level from provider metadata and
  runtime manifests. The provider-docs generator now checks that index alongside the provider
  catalog tables.
- Added user-facing error-message regression coverage for CLI world/scenario failures, unsupported
  capability names, provider budget failures, and secret/path redaction. CLI errors now include a
  command owner context plus a first triage step while redacting signed URLs, secret assignments,
  and host-local paths.
- Added contributor task starter packs for provider, docs-only, demo, artifact/report,
  evaluation/benchmark, and CLI/operator work, with issue-template links and docs tests guarding
  required sections, validation commands, evidence artifacts, docs/changelog expectations, and
  review checklists.
- Added `scripts/generate_release_notes.py`, a maintainer-editable release notes draft generator
  that assembles `CHANGELOG.md`, optional closed GitHub issue metadata, release evidence JSON,
  validation summaries, docs/public-surface links, caveats, compatibility notes, and host-owned
  optional runtime evidence without publishing a GitHub release or changing tag/signing workflows.
- Added `scripts/generate_dependency_audit_evidence.py`, a checkout-safe dependency-audit evidence
  wrapper that runs the documented locked `uv export` plus `pip-audit` flow through a temporary
  requirements file and writes JSON/Markdown summaries with tool versions, dependency-set digest,
  vulnerability summaries, explicit ignore rationales, sanitized command output, and first triage
  steps.
- Added `scripts/generate_quality_dashboard.py`, a local quality dashboard generator that reads
  release evidence, dependency-audit evidence, and core-performance output, then writes JSON and
  Markdown summaries with normalized pass/fail/warning/skip/not-run statuses, command lines,
  timestamps, raw failure details, skipped host-owned checks, and the first failed gate.
- Added a public custom evaluation-suite authoring API: `EvaluationSuite.custom(...)`,
  process-local `EvaluationSuite.register(...)` / `from_registered(...)`, callable
  `EvaluationScenario.from_callable(...)`, `EvaluationContext`, and `EvaluationScenarioOutcome`.
  Custom reports reuse the existing provenance, failure-gallery, artifact, and claim-boundary
  machinery while rejecting non-JSON metric payloads.
- Added provider-agnostic action candidate helpers for score and policy+score workflows:
  `cartesian_offset_candidates(...)`, `object_near_candidates(...)`,
  `swap_action_candidates(...)`, `bounded_move_grid_candidates(...)`,
  `normalize_action_candidates(...)`, and `action_candidates_to_score_payload(...)`.
- Added fixture snapshot governance for source-controlled JSON fixtures. The new
  `worldforge.testing.fixture_snapshots` helpers and `scripts/manage_fixture_snapshots.py` validate
  `tests/fixtures/fixture-snapshots.json` against capability fixtures, provider payload fixtures,
  benchmark inputs, scenario files, and scene artifact fixtures, with review output that separates
  accidental drift from entries marked `intended-update`.
- Added a checkout-safe GR00T PolicyClient replay flow in TheWorldHarness. The flow replays a
  sanitized saved policy response through `GrootPolicyClientProvider`, validates `eef_9d`,
  `gripper_position`, and `joint_position` tensor shapes, translates the trajectory into
  WorldForge actions, and preserves a replay artifact without requiring CUDA, checkpoints, raw
  observations, private endpoints, or GPU logs.
- Added `docs/src/roadmap-expansion-2.md`, a second 30-issue roadmap expansion across
  production-grade quality/DevX/docs, demos and end-to-end showcases, and new features. The batch
  focuses on artifact schema governance, executable docs snippets, optional dependency import
  boundaries, provider configuration indexing, external-provider demos, capability preflight
  demos, scenario matrices, runtime asset manifests, report renderer extension points, and composed
  workflow traces.
- Added static HTML report export for evaluation reports, benchmark reports,
  preserved-run comparisons, and issue-ready bundles. `worldforge eval`,
  `worldforge benchmark`, `worldforge runs compare`, and `worldforge runs
  bundle` accept `--format html`; `worldforge runs bundle` always also writes
  `summary.html` and `issue.html` to the bundle directory. The HTML output is
  self-contained — inline CSS only, no JavaScript, no external assets, no
  anchor tags. All user-supplied text is escaped via `html.escape`. New public
  surface: `worldforge.html_report.render_evaluation_html`,
  `render_benchmark_html`, `render_comparison_html`,
  `render_evidence_bundle_html`, `render_issue_bundle_html`,
  `HTML_REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION`. Documentation lives at
  `docs/src/html-reports.md`, including when to prefer HTML versus
  JSON/Markdown.
- Added JSON-native world state diff and patch artifacts. `worldforge world
  diff <source> <target>` walks two persisted worlds (default) or two exported
  JSON files (with `--source-path --target-path`) and emits a
  schema-versioned diff covering top-level fields (`name`, `provider`,
  `description`, `step`, `metadata`), scene-object additions/removals/updates
  with before/after payloads, and a history summary. The companion
  `WorldPatch.from_diff(diff)` and `apply_patch(state, patch)` helpers apply
  changes to a base snapshot, validating each operation through `SceneObject`,
  `Position`, and `BBox` so traversal-shaped IDs, incoherent bounding boxes,
  malformed pose payloads, or removing missing objects raise `WorldStateError`
  instead of silently corrupting state. New public surface:
  `worldforge.world_diff.diff_worlds`, `diff_worlds_from_paths`,
  `apply_patch`, `WorldDiff`, `WorldPatch`, `ObjectChange`,
  `WorldFieldChange`, `WORLD_DIFF_SCHEMA_VERSION`. Documentation lives at
  `docs/src/world-diff.md`.
- Added a JSON-native scenario definition format and a runner. The new
  `worldforge.scenarios` module ships `Scenario`, `ScenarioObjectSpec`,
  `ScenarioAction`, `ScenarioExpectedArtifact`, and `ScenarioResult`. A
  scenario captures a checkout-safe recipe — provider, initial scene
  objects, an ordered sequence of typed actions (`move_to`, `spawn_object`,
  `predict`), and expected artifacts (`object_count`, `step`,
  `object_position`) — that runs end-to-end through `World.predict` without
  arbitrary Python execution. `worldforge scenario validate <path>` and
  `worldforge scenario run <path>` validate and execute scenario files;
  the run exits non-zero when any expectation fails. New public surface:
  `load_scenario`, `parse_scenario`, `run_scenario`, `Scenario`,
  `ScenarioAction`, `ScenarioObjectSpec`, `ScenarioExpectedArtifact`,
  `ScenarioExpectationCheck`, `ScenarioResult`, `SCENARIO_SCHEMA_VERSION`,
  `SCENARIO_ACTION_KINDS`. Sample scenarios live under
  `examples/scenarios/`. Documentation lives at `docs/src/scenarios.md`.
- Added a local run artifact index. `worldforge runs index --workspace-dir <dir>`
  walks `<dir>/runs/` read-only and emits a sanitized summary of every preserved
  run workspace, with optional filters for provider (substring), capability,
  status, date range, and safe-artifact type. Output is JSON, Markdown, or CSV.
  Stale or malformed run directories surface as typed issue rows
  (`manifest-missing`, `manifest-unreadable`, `manifest-invalid-json`,
  `manifest-not-object`) instead of crashing the walk. New public surface:
  `worldforge.harness.run_index.build_run_index`, `RunIndex`, `RunIndexIssue`,
  `RUN_INDEX_SCHEMA_VERSION`. Documentation lives at `docs/src/run-index.md`,
  including retention/cleanup interaction guidance.
- Added typed provider routing and fallback policies. The new
  `worldforge.provider_routing` module ships `ProviderRoutingPolicy`,
  `RoutingAttempt`, `RoutingResult`, and `route_capability(policy, forge, *,
  invoke)`. Routing tries a preferred provider followed by an ordered fallback
  list, validates capability compatibility before invoking each provider, and
  records every attempt — succeeded, failed, skipped-not-registered, or
  skipped-incompatible — in the returned result. Failures are captured with the
  exception class name and `str(exc)` and never silently masked; the underlying
  observable-capability `ProviderEvent` stream is preserved unchanged. New
  public surface: `ProviderRoutingPolicy`, `RoutingAttempt`, `RoutingResult`,
  `ROUTING_ATTEMPT_STATUSES`, `route_capability`. Documentation lives at
  `docs/src/provider-routing.md`, including guidance on when fallback is and is
  not appropriate.
- Added Python entry-point discovery for external provider packages. Third-party adapters can
  register through the `worldforge.providers` entry-point group; `WorldForge` auto-registers
  the resulting providers when their `configured()` check passes and records typed skip
  reasons (missing dependency, duplicate name, non-callable factory, factory raised) on the
  new `WorldForge.entry_point_discovery()` report. A constructor flag and the
  `WORLDFORGE_DISABLE_ENTRY_POINTS` environment variable both turn discovery off. New public
  surface: `discover_entry_point_providers`, `EntryPointDiscoveryReport`, `EntryPointSkip`,
  `ENTRY_POINT_GROUP`, and `ENTRY_POINT_DISABLE_ENV_VAR`. Documentation lives at
  `docs/src/external-providers.md`.
- Added capability negotiation reports through the new `worldforge negotiate` CLI subcommand
  and `worldforge.capability_negotiation` Python surface. Reports state — before a workflow
  runs — whether the registered and known providers can satisfy a capability set such as
  `generate-only`, `score-only`, `policy-plus-score`, `transfer-only`, or one of the
  evaluation suites' required-capability shapes. For each capability slot the report lists
  every candidate provider's registration, configuration, health, capability compatibility,
  readiness state (`ready`, `missing-config`, `missing-dependency`, `unsupported`,
  `not-registered`), and a typed reason; blocked workflows surface focused recommended
  actions. Output is JSON + Markdown; the CLI exits non-zero when at least one workflow is
  blocked, which makes it suitable as a CI guard.
- Upgraded the release evidence generator into a release-readiness command that writes Markdown and
  JSON summaries, can execute checkout-safe gates with `--run-gates`, records skipped and failed
  gate triage steps, and marks optional live-provider evidence as host-owned unless a prepared-host
  run manifest is linked.
- Added a public API stability and deprecation policy covering stable, provisional, experimental,
  and internal surfaces, with migration expectations for provider capabilities and artifact
  schemas.
- Added a troubleshooting matrix for public error families, provider contract failures, benchmark
  budget exits, and docs-build warnings with owner, command, artifact, and first-triage guidance.
- Added a documented-command drift checker for README, CLI docs, examples, operations, playbooks,
  and AGENTS command surfaces, and wired it into the release-readiness gate.
- Added a checkout-safe core performance budget checker for world persistence, benchmark fixture
  loading, provider diagnostics, evidence-bundle creation, and report rendering, and wired it into
  release-readiness documentation.
- Added a contributor bootstrap doctor for Python, uv, docs tooling, GitHub CLI auth, source-tree
  shape, and optional runtime skip reasons.
- Added supply-chain and artifact integrity documentation covering current package/evidence gates,
  hashes, unsafe artifact exclusions, and future SBOM/provenance/attestation boundaries.
- Added a wrapper portability checker for shell wrappers and optional-runtime smoke commands, and
  wired it into CI and release-readiness gates.
- Reworked the public docs information architecture around reader paths for provider authors,
  operators, evaluators, release maintainers, demos, and roadmap history.
- Added a checkout-safe demo showcase runner with ten issue-backed workflows covering first-run
  local worlds, diagnostic issue bundles, robotics replay, remote media dry-runs, adapter authoring,
  batch eval, stdlib service host, Rerun gallery manifests, failure recovery labs, and cookbook
  validation, plus public docs and recipes for the preserved artifacts and triage steps.
- Added a roadmap expansion plan for 30 structured GitHub issues across production-grade
  quality/DevX/docs, demos and end-to-end showcases, and new features, explicitly excluding the
  already assigned Nano World Model work.
- Added contributor triage guidance for roadmap stream, capability, severity, and release-scope
  labels, and routed provider plus evaluation/benchmark issue templates to provider promotion,
  evidence, and private-security reporting expectations.
- Added read-only local state preflight through `worldforge world preflight`. It checks world state
  directories, file-safe requested IDs, corrupted world JSON, invalid histories, object bounding
  boxes, preserved run manifests, stale run workspaces, unsafe artifact paths, and retention
  pressure while returning safe-to-attach diagnostics and explicit quarantine or dry-run recovery
  commands.
- Added checkout-safe operator failure drills through `worldforge drills`. The drills cover missing
  credentials, missing optional dependencies, malformed provider output, benchmark budget
  violations, corrupted local world state, expired artifacts, and unsafe event metadata while
  preserving run manifests and optional issue bundles under the requested workspace.
- Added reference host deployment recipes for the stdlib service, batch evaluation, and robotics
  operator hosts. The recipes cover env templates, process/readiness/smoke/logging/evidence
  commands, expected success signals, first triage and rollback steps, and the checkout-safe,
  prepared-host, credentialed, GPU-bound, and robotics-lab ownership boundaries.
- Added issue-ready bundles for preserved run workspaces. `worldforge runs bundle <run-id>` now
  exports one run to `evidence_manifest.json`, `summary.md`, and `issue.md`, prints a short issue
  template, preserves SHA-256 digests and `safe_to_attach` flags, and marks unsafe or host-local
  artifacts before attachment.
- Added preserved-run history actions to TheWorldHarness. The Runs screen and
  `worldforge harness --runs` can filter run workspaces by provider, capability, status, date, and
  safe artifact type; rows expose sanitized rerun commands plus issue-bundle and comparison actions,
  with failed/skipped/cancelled runs surfacing the recovery bundle command first.
- Provider scaffolding now generates a fuller fail-closed contract pack: an explicit
  `--implementation-status scaffold` maturity claim, provider/profile tests for disabled
  capability calls, placeholder fixtures marked as non-evidence, an incomplete `.json.stub`
  runtime manifest, a workbench checklist, and printed validation commands. Existing scaffold
  files still require `--force` before overwrite.
- Added an adapter author workbench flow for provider promotion evidence. The non-Textual
  workbench now handles catalog providers, scaffold providers, and the direct-construction
  `jepa-wms` candidate; reports include runtime manifest status, fixture coverage, docs/catalog
  drift, redaction checks, promotion gaps by target status, safe artifact references, and validation
  commands, and `worldforge harness --flow workbench` exposes the same logic through TheWorldHarness.
- Added cross-provider run comparisons for preserved eval and benchmark workspaces. `worldforge
  runs compare` now exports a shared JSON/Markdown/CSV model with provider rows, capability and
  operation context, fixture digest, suite version, budget status, event counts, missing evidence,
  skip reasons, and claim-boundary language while refusing incompatible capability, fixture,
  budget, operation, or suite-version contexts.
- Added sanitized evaluation failure galleries. Failed evaluation reports now expose
  representative fixture-level cases with expected contract notes, observed summaries, metrics
  previews, and triage steps; `report.artifacts()` also exports `failure_gallery.json` and
  `failure_gallery.md` for issue attachments.
- Added benchmark budget calibration artifacts generated from preserved benchmark JSON reports.
  `scripts/calibrate_benchmark_budgets.py` writes a loadable `candidate-budgets.json`, a full
  `budget-calibration.json`, and a human-review Markdown report with source report digests,
  machine context, old thresholds, candidate thresholds, observed baselines, and rationale fields
  without modifying existing release budget files.
- Added a claim-to-evidence map for public README-level claims, capability surfaces, runtime
  boundaries, preserved artifacts, and explicit non-claims.
- Added a checkout-safe evidence bundle exporter for preserved eval and benchmark runs. The
  bundle copies safe reports, run manifests, event logs, preset inputs, and budget fixtures,
  records SHA-256 digests and `safe_to_attach` flags, excludes unsafe or local-only artifacts, and
  can be linked from release evidence reports.
- Added five named benchmark presets — `mock-smoke`, `parser-overhead`, `remote-media-dryrun`,
  `prepared-host`, and `release-evidence` — exposed through new `worldforge benchmark
  --list-presets`, `--show-preset`, and `--preset` flags. Presets bundle a deterministic input
  fixture, an optional budget file, and a runtime-profile gate so checkout-safe regression
  checks, remote-media dry-runs, prepared-host evidence runs, and release gating each have a
  named entry point. Remote-media and prepared-host presets skip with a typed reason when the
  required provider environment is missing; checkout-safe and release presets fail non-zero on
  budget violations. Public surface lives at `worldforge.benchmark_presets` (`BenchmarkPreset`,
  `list_presets`, `get_preset`, `load_preset_inputs`, `load_preset_budgets`).
- Added a packaged capability fixture corpus under `worldforge.testing.fixtures` covering the
  `predict`, `reason`, `embed`, `generate`, `transfer`, `score`, and `policy` capabilities.
  Each capability ships one valid baseline plus at least two invalid boundary fixtures with
  distinct error patterns. The new `worldforge.testing.load_capability_fixture`,
  `iter_capability_fixtures`, `iter_all_fixtures`, `list_fixture_names`, and `CapabilityFixture`
  helpers let conformance tests, evaluation suites, and provider authors reuse canonical
  inputs instead of inlining payloads. The `assert_*_conformance()` helpers' keyword arguments
  match each fixture's `payload` keys so a fixture can be passed straight through.
- Added a result `provenance` envelope (`schema_version: 2`) to evaluation and benchmark JSON
  and Markdown reports. The envelope carries WorldForge version, command argv, providers,
  capabilities, runtime manifest references, input and result digests, budget file summary,
  emitted `ProviderEvent` count, suite contract version, claim boundary, and metric semantics
  so a claim can be reproduced and cited without console logs. CSV output, the existing
  `run_metadata.input_file`, and `run_metadata.budget_file` fields are unchanged for
  backward compatibility.
- Added `cosmos-policy` as a host-owned NVIDIA Cosmos-Policy ALOHA `/act` server adapter for the
  `policy` capability, including a runtime manifest, live-smoke CLI, provider docs, configuration
  summaries, and policy-plus-score planning coverage without adding CUDA, Docker, torch, or
  Cosmos-Policy dependencies to the base package.
- Added an optional OpenTelemetry provider-event sink that maps sanitized provider events to
  host-owned tracing spans without adding OpenTelemetry to the base dependency set.
- Added an optional Rerun integration for sanitized `ProviderEvent` streams, world snapshots,
  plans, benchmark reports, and arbitrary JSON artifacts through `RerunEventSink`,
  `RerunArtifactLogger`, `RerunSession`, and `RerunRecordingConfig`.
- Added the `rerun` optional extra and `worldforge-demo-rerun`, a checkout-safe showcase that
  writes a local `.rrd` recording by default and supports spawned, remote, or in-process gRPC
  Rerun viewer workflows. The extra accepts the Rerun SDK range needed to coexist with LeRobot
  runtime environments.
- Added Rerun visual layers for 3D world object boxes, robotics candidate targets, selected replay
  paths, score bars, and latency bars. `scripts/robotics-showcase` now writes a Rerun `.rrd`
  artifact for normal PushT policy+score runs unless `--no-rerun` is passed.
- Added a roadmap continuation document that defines the next three GitHub issue streams:
  provider evidence and runtime cohorts, evaluation evidence and claim integrity, and operator
  workflow plus adapter authoring.
- Added a provider cohort selection record that scores active and deferred provider candidates,
  selects the next evidence cohort, and keeps provider catalog claims unchanged until runtime
  evidence exists.
- Added a spatial scene artifact boundary record for future 3D scene providers, including
  candidate decisions, JSON-native artifact shape, asset redaction rules, host-owned
  responsibilities, and the fixture contract for follow-up validation.
- Added `validate_scene_artifact` for checkout-safe spatial scene artifact validation, plus tiny
  valid and malformed fixtures covering transforms, units, non-finite values, unsafe references,
  and oversized metadata.
- Added a live-smoke evidence registry with schema validation, first-class missing-runtime and
  missing-credential skip statuses, docs for safe provider issue attachments, and release-evidence
  rendering support.
- Added a JEPA-WMS runtime manifest for prepared-host smoke evidence and a stable `input_digest`
  field for smoke run manifests with synthetic input summaries.
- Added an optional live robotics showcase workflow for pull request and main-branch push
  validation.
  It runs real LeRobot policy inference plus real LeWorldModel checkpoint scoring in
  non-interactive JSON mode, validates the resulting provider events and tensor contract, caches
  Hugging Face/LeWorldModel checkpoint assets with `actions/cache`, and uploads sanitized run
  evidence artifacts.

### Fixed

- Runway artifact downloads now validate provider-returned URLs before fetching, block local,
  private, and link-local destinations unless explicitly opted in, and stream downloaded bytes with
  a hard size cap instead of buffering unbounded response bodies.
- Preserved LeRobot loader provenance after lazy policy loading so real `from_pretrained` runs no
  longer report as `injected_policy` in policy result metadata or provider events.
- Documented first triage commands for Cosmos and Runway media artifacts and added focused
  provider-level regression tests for failed, malformed, unsupported, expired, and retry-exhausted
  remote media paths.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added a MkDocs Material documentation site, strict docs-build validation, and a GitHub Pages
  workflow that deploys the site from `main`.
- Added `SECURITY.md` with the vulnerability-reporting path and supported-version policy.
- Added public governance and contributor surfaces: code of conduct, support policy, maintainer
  ownership, citation metadata, issue templates, pull request template, and CODEOWNERS.
- Added documented `examples/benchmark-inputs.json` and `examples/benchmark-budget.json` fixtures
  so README and docs benchmark commands are copy-paste runnable.
- Added explicit claim-boundary and metric-semantics fields to evaluation and benchmark JSON and
  Markdown reports.
- Added capability-protocol registration for narrow `Cost`, `Policy`, `Generator`, `Predictor`,
  `Reasoner`, `Embedder`, and `Transferer` implementations, including diagnostics, planning, and
  benchmark routing without requiring a full `BaseProvider` subclass.
- Added an engineering quality standards page that maps WorldForge's Python packaging, testing,
  linting, typed-distribution, ML reproducibility, and robotics-runtime boundaries to upstream
  Python and scientific-computing guidance.
- Exported benchmark budget and fixture-loading helpers from the top-level Python package so
  provider benchmarking workflows do not need to reach into implementation modules.

### Fixed

- Scene object mutations and prediction actions now validate history payload JSON before committing
  state changes, so malformed metadata or action payloads cannot leave an in-memory world half
  mutated.
- Provider events now sanitize observable request targets and obvious secret-bearing message or
  metadata fields before logs or in-memory sinks can record them. Signed artifact URLs keep
  scheme/host/path context but drop query strings, fragments, and userinfo.
- Cosmos and Runway now strip whitespace and treat blank environment variables as unset, matching
  the behaviour of every other provider. A blank `COSMOS_BASE_URL`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY`,
  `RUNWAYML_BASE_URL`, `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET`, or `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` no longer masks as
  configured.
- `scripts/test_package.sh` now installs the built wheel generically instead of assuming the old
  `worldforge-*.whl` filename prefix, so the package contract still works after the
  `worldforge-ai` rename.
- `scripts/test_package.sh` now validates wheel and sdist contents before installing the wheel,
  including capability protocol files, the `py.typed` marker, console scripts, and source-package
  docs/tests/scripts.
- Public JSON-carrying models now reject non-JSON-native action parameters, scene metadata,
  provider-event metadata, score metadata, policy raw actions, and policy metadata at construction
  time instead of allowing values that fail later during persistence or artifact serialization.
- `PredictionPayload`, `EvaluationResult`, provider summaries, and `BenchmarkResult` now validate
  their JSON fields, finite metrics, score ranges, counts, and result coherence at construction
  time so invalid report artifacts fail before rendering.
- World import/load validation now requires the persisted schema version, validates embedded scene
  object payloads, rejects `SceneObjectPatch` misuse, and treats a single provider string in
  `World.compare(...)` as one provider rather than a sequence of characters.
- Capability protocol adapters now wrap unexpected runtime exceptions as `ProviderError` after
  emitting failure events.
- LeWorldModel direct scoring now validates checkpoint-native candidate shape and requires one
  returned score per candidate sample before constructing `ActionScoreResult`.
- Benchmark budget fixtures now reject unknown top-level or budget-entry keys so typoed release
  thresholds fail closed.
- The LeWorldModel object-checkpoint builder now supports pinned Hugging Face revisions and loads
  downloaded weights with `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)` by default. The
  `--allow-unsafe-pickle` escape hatch is explicit for trusted legacy weights only.
- `scripts/robotics-showcase --health-only` no longer auto-builds or downloads a missing
  LeWorldModel object checkpoint; preflight reports checkpoint absence without mutating the cache.
- Production CLI and LeRobot provider checks now raise explicit WorldForge errors instead of
  relying on Python `assert` statements that disappear under optimized execution.

### Changed

- CI workflows now run on Python 3.13 only. The multi-version OS/Python test matrix was removed,
  and Pages, release, and security jobs were aligned to the same interpreter version.
- Package metadata, docs, optional-runtime wrapper commands, and lint target now declare Python
  3.13 only so the published support contract matches CI.
- Package metadata now uses SPDX license metadata and an explicit `uv` package marker, while the
  Hatch wheel target is restricted to runtime package files.
- Pytest now runs with importlib import mode and strict xfail handling, while Ruff enforces sorted
  exports, explicit mutable class metadata annotations, literal exception-match patterns, and
  clearer pytest imports/assertions.
- Ruff now also enforces comprehension, simplification, return, performance, pytest-style, and
  Ruff-native correctness rules across `src`, `tests`, `examples`, and `scripts`.
- Provider contract helpers now use explicit `AssertionError` checks instead of Python `assert`
  statements, so reusable adapter validation still runs under optimized Python.
- Dedupe repeated provider scaffolding into shared `BaseProvider._emit_operation_event` and
  `BaseProvider._health` helpers, and move `no_grad_context` plus `prepare_model` into
  `providers/_policy.py`. The cosmos, runway, leworldmodel, lerobot, gr00t, and jepa-wms adapters
  are unchanged externally but significantly shorter internally.
- Consolidate the shared `blue_cube` tabletop scenario used by the LeRobot and LeWorldModel demos
  into `worldforge.demos.make_blue_cube` / `blue_cube_goal` / `make_candidate_plans`.
- TheWorldHarness no longer eagerly imports `worldforge.demos.*` at module load; demo flow
  runners import lazily so the harness cold start does not drag the optional-runtime provider
  classes into memory.
- The robotics showcase wrapper no longer suppresses LeRobot runtime device fallback warnings, so
  CUDA-to-MPS or similar execution changes remain visible in the terminal.
- Documentation now routes release validation through explicit `uv`/`bash` gate commands, keeps
  robotics preflight commands visible from the README/CLI/examples pages, and splits long optional
  runtime commands into copy-pasteable blocks.
- The robotics showcase deep dive now includes end-to-end flow, model payload, inference
  responsibility, and sequence diagrams that show how LeRobot policy inference, LeWorldModel cost
  inference, WorldForge planning, mock replay, and the visual report fit together.
- The README, package metadata, citation metadata, docs site description, and introduction now use
  a tighter project pitch: testable world-model workflows for physical-AI systems.
- `save_world` skips a redundant `json.dumps`/`json.loads` round trip; the validation call now
  runs directly against the serialized dict.
- Documentation metadata and README links now point at the published GitHub Pages site.
- Release tags now run the full quality gate before artifacts are built or published: lint,
  formatting, strict docs, coverage, dependency audit, package contract, and tests.
- The release gate now includes the lockfile check, coverage gate, package contract, build, and
  dependency audit using the locked dev environment.
- JEPA and Genie scaffold providers now advertise no executable capabilities. Their deterministic
  mock-backed surrogate path remains available only for local adapter tests with
  `WORLDFORGE_ENABLE_SCAFFOLD_SURROGATES=1`.
- Mock no longer advertises the provider-level `plan` capability; planning remains a WorldForge
  facade workflow built from provider-specific `predict`, `score`, and `policy` surfaces.
- Release publishing now verifies that the pushed tag matches the package version, uses locked
  `pip-audit`, attaches build provenance attestations, and is configured for PyPI trusted
  publishing.

### Security

- Hardened `ProviderEvent` serialization so structured provider logs do not leak bearer tokens,
  API keys, signed URL query strings, or secret-like metadata values.
- Scaffold provider capability fail-closed behavior prevents deterministic surrogate outputs from
  being mistaken for real JEPA or Genie provider results in evals, benchmarks, or public reports.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-22

### Harness

- Added the M3-M5 TheWorldHarness surfaces: `ProvidersScreen` with a capability matrix and a
  cancellable real `mock.predict` run; `EvalScreen` and `BenchmarkScreen` with preserved JSON
  reports; Run Inspector report previews; Home recent worlds/runs; dynamic `Ctrl+P` entries for
  worlds, providers, and saved reports.
- Added the `worldforge-high-contrast` theme to the existing theme cycle and documented the three
  shipped themes.
- Added local harness guard scripts that reject raw hex literals in widget CSS and network-egress
  calls under `src/worldforge/harness/`.
- Added a Textual screenshot export matrix for the main harness screens at `100x30`, `120x40`,
  and `160x50`, plus a deterministic README screenshot regeneration script.
- Reskinned TheWorldHarness with registered `worldforge-dark` and `worldforge-light` themes,
  retiring the hard-coded hex literals in `src/worldforge/harness/tui.py` in favour of semantic
  tokens (`$accent`, `$success`, `$warning`, `$error`, `$panel`, `$boost`, `$surface`, plus the
  custom `$muted` variable) so the harness reads as a polished workspace on light terminals.
- Added a header chrome strip with a `worldforge > <flow>` breadcrumb and a
  `<provider> . <capability>` status pill that update reactively when the selected flow changes.
- Added a hidden `Ctrl+T` binding that cycles between the two registered themes without
  restarting the harness.
- Split TheWorldHarness into a screen stack: a `HomeScreen` landing page with three jump cards
  (`n` create a world, `p` run a provider, `e` run an eval), a `RunInspectorScreen` that owns
  the existing flow visualisation, plus modal `HelpScreen` and `PlaceholderScreen` overlays.
  `worldforge-harness` opens on Home by default and on the Run Inspector when `--flow` is
  passed.
- Added the static command palette layer via `App.get_system_commands` (`Ctrl+P`): "Jump:
  Home", "Jump: Run Inspector", "Open Help", one "Run flow: <title>" entry per registered
  flow, "Switch theme", and the stock Quit. Dynamic entries now index worlds, providers, and
  recent runs.
- Added `?` to open a modal `HelpScreen` that lists every binding declared on the screen below
  it, plus chord bindings `g h` / `g r` for jump-to-Home and jump-to-Run-Inspector.
- Updated the `Header` breadcrumb to reflect the active screen, deepening to the selected flow
  on the Run Inspector (`worldforge › run-inspector › <flow>`).
- Added a standalone Textual report for `scripts/robotics-showcase` that renders the real
  LeRobot-plus-LeWorldModel run as a pipeline trace with metric bars, candidate ranking, provider
  events, and a fixed tabletop replay.
- Improved the robotics showcase report layout into a vertical, scrollable story with full-width
  candidate ranking, full-width tabletop replay, staged reveal delays, and an illustrative animated
  robot-arm replay.
- Added an in-report reading guide for runtime, tensor, and candidate-ranking panes plus a `?`
  tabletop-replay help overlay for the real robotics showcase TUI.

### Added

- Added `lewm-real`, a short `uv run` alias for real LeWorldModel checkpoint inference. The command
  now accepts `--checkpoint`, prints a staged pipeline log by default, and preserves machine-readable
  output with `--json-only`.
- Added `lewm-lerobot-real` and `worldforge-smoke-lerobot-leworldmodel`, a host-owned real
  robotics smoke/showcase that composes LeRobot policy inference with LeWorldModel checkpoint
  scoring through WorldForge policy-plus-score planning, including visual logs and JSON output.
- Added `scripts/robotics-showcase` and `worldforge-robotics-showcase`, a one-command PushT real
  robotics entrypoint that packages the LeRobot observation, LeWorldModel score tensor, translator,
  and action-candidate bridge defaults for the LeRobot + LeWorldModel showcase.
- Expanded the real robotics showcase output with an ASCII pipeline map, runtime bars, score
  summary, candidate target table, and tabletop replay diagram while keeping the machine-readable
  JSON path available.
- Made `scripts/robotics-showcase` launch the Textual visual report by default while preserving
  `--no-tui`, `--json-only`, and `--health-only` for plain terminal, automation, and preflight
  runs.
- Added `--tui-stage-delay` and `--no-tui-animation` to control the robotics showcase reveal pace
  and animation.
- Added the `worldforge world` CLI command group for local JSON persistence workflows, including
  create, list, show, history, export, import, and fork commands backed by the existing validated
  `WorldForge` persistence API.
- Added persisted-world mutation and prediction commands:
  `worldforge world objects`, `add-object`, `update-object`, `remove-object`, and `predict`.
  These commands load local JSON worlds, apply typed scene/action values, and save through
  `WorldForge.save_world(...)`; `world predict --dry-run` previews provider output without
  replacing the saved file.
- Added `WorldForge.delete_world(...)` and `worldforge world delete` so local JSON world removal
  uses the same validated persistence boundary as save/load/import/fork. TheWorldHarness now calls
  this public API instead of unlinking world files directly.
- Added persisted history entries for scene object add/update/remove mutations, including typed
  `Action` payloads and snapshots that can be restored or forked. Object position patches now
  translate bounding boxes with the pose to keep local scene state coherent.
- Added `worldforge examples` with Markdown and JSON output so CLI users can discover checkout
  scripts, packaged demos, and optional smoke commands without scanning repository docs.
- Added the `worldforge-demo-lerobot` console command and packaged the LeRobot policy-plus-score
  planning walkthrough under `src/worldforge/demos/lerobot_e2e.py`, keeping
  `examples/lerobot_e2e_demo.py` as a compatibility wrapper.
- Added `examples/README.md` as a short command index for the checkout scripts and packaged demos.
- Added CLI help snapshot tests for the primary `worldforge` command surface.
- Added `scripts/generate_provider_docs.py` so the provider catalog table can be refreshed and
  checked from `src/worldforge/providers/catalog.py`.
- Added `worldforge provider docs` so users can discover provider documentation paths from the CLI.
- Added TheWorldHarness as an optional Textual TUI (`worldforge-harness` and `worldforge harness`)
  for visually running and inspecting packaged E2E demos.
- Added a TheWorldHarness diagnostics flow for provider catalog inspection and mock benchmark
  comparison across predict, reason, generate, and transfer.
- Added benchmark budget gates for release and claim-oriented checks. `worldforge benchmark` can
  load a JSON budget file, print gate violations, and exit non-zero when success-rate,
  error-count, retry-count, latency, throughput, or unmatched-budget checks fail.
- Added benchmark input fixtures. `worldforge benchmark --input-file benchmark-inputs.json` now
  loads deterministic JSON inputs for prediction, generation, transfer, embedding, score, and
  policy runs; transfer clips can point at files relative to the input JSON or inline base64
  frames.
- Added `.env.example` documenting every provider environment variable recognized by
  WorldForge (`COSMOS_BASE_URL`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` and the legacy
  `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` alias, `RUNWAYML_BASE_URL`, `LEWORLDMODEL_POLICY` and the legacy
  `LEWM_POLICY` alias, `LEWORLDMODEL_CACHE_DIR`, `LEWORLDMODEL_DEVICE`, the full
  `GROOT_POLICY_*` and `GROOT_EMBODIMENT_TAG` set, the full `LEROBOT_*` set including the
  legacy `LEROBOT_POLICY` alias, the `JEPA_WMS_*` candidate variables, and the scaffold
  `JEPA_MODEL_PATH` and `GENIE_API_KEY`).
- Added `lerobot` as a first-class optional policy provider for Hugging Face LeRobot
  pretrained policies. The adapter lazily imports LeRobot, supports injectable policies and
  policy loaders for offline testing, validates observation payloads, preserves raw policy
  tensors, and requires a host-owned action translator before returning executable WorldForge
  actions.
- Added `leworldmodel` as a first-class optional score provider for LeWorldModel JEPA cost
  models, including `ActionScoreResult`, `WorldForge.score_actions(...)`, score-output
  validation, provider profile metadata, and fixture-driven tests.
- Added score-based planning, the `policy` capability, `ActionPolicyResult`,
  `WorldForge.select_actions(...)`, policy-only planning, and policy-plus-score planning.
- Added experimental host-owned `gr00t` PolicyClient support, a `jepa-wms` direct-construction
  score-provider candidate scaffold, and `scripts/scaffold_provider.py` for safe provider
  scaffolding.
- Added checkout-safe LeWorldModel and LeRobot demos plus optional LeWorldModel/GR00T/LeRobot
  smoke entry points for host-owned runtimes.

### Changed

- Bumped project metadata and public citation references to `0.4.0`.
- Validated provider capability names across public capability checks and CLI provider filters,
  so typos such as `generation` fail explicitly instead of being treated as unsupported.
- Changed `ProviderCapabilities()` to advertise no operations by default. Providers must opt into
  every capability explicitly, and unsupported `predict()` calls now fail with `ProviderError`
  instead of `NotImplementedError`.
- Centralized in-repo provider discovery in `src/worldforge/providers/catalog.py`, including the
  provider factory list and explicit always-register policy for `mock`. `WorldForge` now uses the
  catalog instead of relying on constructor ordering in `_known_providers()`.
- Extended the provider catalog with documentation-page and runtime-ownership metadata used by the
  generated provider docs table.
- Moved the README provider surface table onto the same generated catalog source as the provider
  docs index.
- Grouped `worldforge examples`, `docs/src/examples.md`, and `examples/README.md` by task so
  prediction, comparison, score planning, policy planning, and optional smoke paths are easier to
  scan.
- Reworked the README, introduction, architecture, provider, and operations docs around the
  capability contract: predictive models, score providers, policy providers, media adapters,
  host-owned optional runtimes, and explicit persistence/evaluation boundaries.
- Added dedicated provider pages for Cosmos, Runway, and LeWorldModel, and normalized the GR00T,
  LeRobot, and JEPA-WMS pages around capability surface, runtime ownership, input/output
  contracts, failure modes, and validation coverage.
- Updated package metadata around WorldForge's physical-AI world-model integration layer, removed
  the development-status classifier, and pointed documentation metadata at repository docs instead
  of a standalone project domain.
- Aligned documented Ruff commands with CI, `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md` by keeping `scripts/` in
  both `ruff check` and `ruff format` targets.

### Fixed

- Rejected non-file-safe world IDs before local persistence reads and writes, preventing traversal
  through imported or caller-supplied world identifiers.
- Validated persisted world history entries end to end, including non-negative entry steps,
  historical snapshot states, non-empty summaries, serialized action payloads, and the invariant
  that history entry steps cannot exceed the current world step.
- Wrote saved worlds through validated same-directory temporary files before atomically replacing
  the destination JSON file.
- Rejected stringly-typed booleans for scene object graspability, provider capabilities, and the
  JEPA-WMS `actions_are_normalized` option instead of silently coercing values such as `"false"`
  to `True`.
- Tracked `.env.example` in the repository by adding an explicit `!.env.example` exception
  to `.gitignore`; the general `.env.*` glob was silently excluding the onboarding template.
- Rejected non-finite public numeric inputs for positions, rotations, request policies, provider
  events, video clips, reasoning confidence, embedding vectors, generation FPS, and prediction
  payload metrics.
- Rejected duplicate scene object IDs when adding objects to a world.
- Rejected persisted/provider-supplied world state whose scene-object map key disagrees with the
  object's embedded `id`.
- Made the coverage gate invoke pytest with the `harness` extra so optional Textual TUI tests are
  available during coverage runs while the base package and matrix tests remain free of Textual.
- Validated Runway ratio parsing before constructing returned clip metadata.
- Validated Cosmos health and generation response payloads before decoding returned videos.
- Validated Runway organization, task creation, task polling, task output, artifact content type,
  expired artifact, and empty artifact responses before returning clips.
- Corrected the LeWorldModel smoke task to require an existing upstream object checkpoint instead
  of relying on a nonexistent PyPI checkpoint-preparation helper.
- Updated the real LeWorldModel smoke instructions to use the GitHub `stable-worldmodel` source
  package and `datasets>=2.21`, matching the runtime that can load supported LeWM checkpoints.
- Rejected score-based plans when the score provider returns a different number of scores than
  executable candidate action plans, preventing provider-native score tensors from drifting away
  from the actions WorldForge can execute or report.

### Security

- Hardened local JSON persistence against path traversal by validating world IDs before resolving
  storage paths.
- Raised the development dependency floor to `pytest>=9.0.3` and refreshed `uv.lock` to remove
  the locked `pytest 9.0.2` vulnerability reported as `CVE-2025-71176`.

### Documentation

- Added `AGENTS.md` with repository identity, architecture, commands, conventions, constraints,
  and gotchas for contributors.
- Promoted the real LeRobot-plus-LeWorldModel robotics showcase to the top of the README with
  screenshots, a one-command entrypoint, and a dedicated walkthrough covering the pipeline,
  runtime boundaries, artifacts, and customization path.
- Added a dedicated CLI reference and reduced duplicate README/provider demo prose so the public
  front face points to one command map instead of repeating optional-runtime narratives.
- Added user and operator playbooks for checkout validation, provider capability selection,
  provider diagnostics, adapter promotion, local persistence recovery, remote artifacts, optional
  runtime smokes, benchmarks, incident triage, and release gates.
- Added this changelog and linked it from the README.
- Documented host-owned persistence, provider limits, and provider workflow failure modes.
- Added a world-model taxonomy document, plus expanded architecture docs with text and
  Mermaid diagrams for provider injection, predictive planning, score-based planning, observability,
  and the LeWorldModel-shaped runtime pipeline.
- Added a provider authoring guide that turns the taxonomy into capability, validation, testing,
  observability, and documentation checklists for new adapters.
- Documented GR00T live-smoke requirements for Isaac-GR00T's CUDA/TensorRT runtime and the remote
  policy-server path for unsupported hosts.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Typed planning goals for `object_at`, `object_near`, `spawn_object`, and `swap_objects`.
- Built-in evaluation suites for generation, physics, planning, reasoning, and transfer.
- Provider benchmark harness with latency, retry, throughput, JSON, Markdown, and CSV reporting.
- Provider observability through `ProviderEvent`, JSON logging, in-memory recording, and metrics
  aggregation sinks.
- HTTP-backed Cosmos and Runway beta adapters with typed request policy and retry behavior.
- Reusable provider contract checks under `worldforge.testing`.

### Notes

Constraints carried forward from this release; see the docs site for the current status of each:

- JEPA and Genie remain scaffold adapters backed by deterministic mock behavior after credential
  checks.
- Evaluation scores are deterministic adapter contract signals, not physical fidelity or media
  quality guarantees.
- World persistence is local JSON and is not safe as a concurrent multi-writer store.
